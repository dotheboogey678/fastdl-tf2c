I feel like I tend to overexplain how I -think- server-stuff works, so let's try a direct approach.
If you wanna host a server, LAN or Internet, have this folder loaded into your TF2C install's / server's custom folder!
Servers can load mods, too. Just toss it in so it looks somethin' like this:
(Placeholder names for folders, change it to yours!)

...\tf2c_server\custom\[nowp scripts for servers!!]

For LAN, I'd recommend just telling your friends / community when you're gonna host the server,
and link back to NOWP's page for easy grabbin'. You can find it here!

It's way faster than FastDL, but requires your folks install it themselves. FYI!

For online servers specifically, I reckon you upload the contents of the maps folder
onto some file host FastDL can use, so it looks like so:
(Placeholder names for website and folders, change it to yours!)

https://www.SomeFastDLHost.com/FastDLFolderName/tf2c_server/maps/custom_items_game.txt
https://www.SomeFastDLHost.com/FastDLFolderName/tf2c_server/maps/custom_level_sounds.txt
https://www.SomeFastDLHost.com/FastDLFolderName/tf2c_server/maps/custom_particles.txt

Also for servers, I guess it's up to you what you want clients to do for the actual assets.
If you want to host them on FastDL for... some reason, open up tf2c_newoldweapons_assets_dir.vpk,
extract everything, then upload it to the same FastDL host you were using for the scripts!

Just a quick note, if you'd hear me! If you're hosting an online server, I'm flattered!!

But, I'd really prefer if the general content of New-Old Weapons Pack was left unaltered.
You can add weapons on top, or make a few balance changes! I don't really mind!
But, I'd much appreciate for the mod to still be mostly intact. Thanks.
