//----------------------// Starting from here are some includes to make life easier for all of us! These hook custom game_sounds files - for Soundscripts!
//----------------------// New as of NOWP v2.2.5 are just some extra entries here for your conveniences - if you think it'd help to use them? I dunno!! It's still your choice!
//--- User Additions ---//
//----------------------// I've moved NOWP to the very bottom, so you guys can replace my soundscripts with your own if you really want.
//----------------------// If you think the ordering or naming needs adjusting, let me know!

// Catch-all if you just wanna add your own stuff quickly! Above everything else to take priority. Make + use one of these if you want to add your own sound-scripts; all 5 are unused.
