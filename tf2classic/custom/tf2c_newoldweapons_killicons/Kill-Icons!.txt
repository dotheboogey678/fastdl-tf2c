This file is for everything that handles Kill-Icons in TF2C!
Yes, it's mighty small, but this is really all you need, beside assignin' them to weapons in items_game.txt

If you want to make your very own, read this Imgur Album I made!

If you want to add other folks' Kill-Icons into your own, or into this pack, look inside the file
[scripts/hud_textures.txt]

//-------------//
Kill-Icons have 3 moving parts, 2 of which are in front of you here. They are;

-d_ and dneg_ .vmt and .vtf files
(These are the actual icons images themselves!)

-hud_textures.txt or mod_textures.txt
(These are some Text Entries that tell the game "where" an icon is, via bounding box!)

-items_game.txt
(You can tell a weapon to use a certain icon entry you defined in hud_textures.txt as a Kill Icon for it!)



That's all I feel like explaining for now - I included a few other resources about it elsewhere!
If all else fails, feel free to ask the TF2C Discord
