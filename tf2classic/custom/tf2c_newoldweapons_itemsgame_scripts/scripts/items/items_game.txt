//-- CUSTOM ITEM SCHEMAS!!! --//
//----------------------------//
//
// [January 12, 2023]
// Okay, listen. It was just a hunch, but after I did some digging, it seemed more and more feasible, so here we go.
// Remember how in June, last year, my friend Yakibomb passed some eldritch ficool2 knowledge to me, revealing "#base" could be used to load extra files for mod_textures.txt to load?
// It works for more. It works for more than just that.
//
// It even works
// FOR ITEMS_GAME.TXT
//
// You guys know what this MEANS, right!?
// It means we can all just hook onto a clean copy of items_game.txt, have this stuff at the top, and we can ALL have our weapons working with no fuss AND no muss!
// As it is, I've already provided mine as an example. I made no modifications to that file, it's JUST the same as a map-specific items_game.txt
// Literally all you do is rename that map-specific file of yours, hook it here, and bam, it WORKS!
//
// Granted, it's still mostly useful for changing the global items_game.txt (which this still does), but it makes it much easier to finally merge packs together, if people feel the urge!
// ALSO, this works with "sv_reload_item_schema"! So you can point all of your map-specifics toward one central file if you're not hosting on a server or something
//
// Okay, on with it, sorry for runnin' my mouth. I'm just excited.
// I've taken the liberty to set it up similarly to hud_textures.txt, so we can start setting up shop more easily.
//
