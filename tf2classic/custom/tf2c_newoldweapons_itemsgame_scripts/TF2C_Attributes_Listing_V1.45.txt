//--TF2C ATTRIBUTES LISTING-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Heya! This here's a WIP, mostly-complete catalog of what attributes do and don't work in TF2C!
//
// This is only a list of attributes that would otherwise DO SOMETHING! Live TF2 has a lot of filler and background attributes, so let's ignore those. It's stuff like crates.
// Also omitted will be the outlandish attributes, such as for Halloween and Pyrovision, and stuff related to other esoteric features.
//
//
//
// As a rule of thumb - most NEWER attributes will, without fail, not work.
// What is "new?"
// Further back than you think. Before Mannconomy. Before the WAR! Update. Before even the Scout Update..!
//
// Basically, if the attribute is relatively simple to have coded in - like most of the ones near the beginning are - then it's generally in!
// Attributes for weapon concepts or weapon types that didn't exist way back when - Demo swords, Gunslinger, Jarate, you name it, can sometimes show up as text in the description, but are nonfunctional.
//
// SOMETIMES an attribute that shows up in text can end up working, somehow, but more often than not, they don't. Also, if they don't have any description text at all... the might as well not exist 99 times out of 100.
//
//
// Keep this in mind...
//
// Last thing! This document probably isn't the best for beginners - it's a lot of raw information and I expect you to already know how these attributes generally are set up, where they're found, and how they work.
// You're certainly all free to read over it for reference, though! I left a lot of notes on more noteworthy attributes, so do take care to read.
//
// And follow along in TF2C's / Live TF2's items_game.txt, if you like. I encourage it, especially in live TF2's items_game,
// if you find an attribute that looks interesting. (Please, for the love of the Gods, use Ctrl + F)
//
// [By the way, as a quick reference when searching: EVERYTHING after Line 1250 (as of v2.1.3) is part of the "Does Not Work" category and DOES NOT WORK!!
// If you're searching and see something down there, ignore it! I'll move this occasionally, so either observe the range yourself, or check here!]
//
// [Louder, for the people in the back, EVERYTHING AFTER LINE 1250 DOES NOT WORK!!]
//
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






//------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just as a quick refresher, here's a rundown on TF2C's new attributes as of v2.1.1!
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------- These attributes provide a bit of insight into the development behind the scenes, and what order the weapons were tested in!
//--TF2C ADDITIONS - New attributes that show up near the end of items_game.txt-- I'll provide commentary for these, at least, since most are new and some aren't on any existing weapons.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [NOTE: I'm obligated to include ALL new attributes that were added, but some MAY NOT WORK (or even exist) when you try them! I'll try to label them, sometimes stuff just falls through in the course of a game update...]

[v2.0.0 TF2C Release]
3019 - "headshot damage decrease" (headshot_damage_modify)
3020 - "no scope" (mod_no_scope)											- Gets rid of the Scope overlay, but also gets rid of your Damage Charge / Scope-in. Using it on its own behaves strangely - your shots will do 5 dmg for whatever reason.
3021 - "rocket gravity" (mod_rocket_gravity)								- Your rockets sink like a rock, and how much they sink like a rock can be modified by changing the number. Also works for a few other projectiles, like Tranq Darts or Coilgun Lasers. Gravity projs will NOT get immediately removed touching a Skybox! Make sure they have enough grav to eventually drop down!
3022 - "sniper no dmg charge" (mod_sniper_no_dmg_charge)
3023 - "view punch on hit" (add_viewpunch_onhit)							- When hit, the victim of your attack's view gets thrown in a random, front-facing direction. Disorienting... Also, as of TF2C v2.1.0, the viewpunch is, well, view only. Previously, it physically swung your view around, too.
3024 - "tranq on hit" (mod_tranq_onhit)										- Tranq. Enemies get slowed and slightly color blinded, among other things, for a variable amount of time.
3025 - "armor footsteps" (mod_armor_footsteps)								- Plays a thunking sound as you walk around with the item equipped.
3026 - "soft zoom" (mod_sniper_soft_zoom)									- Widens your scoped-in FOV from default zoom.
3027 - "sniper slower scoped fire speed DISPLAY ONLY" (mod_sniper_slower_scoped_fire_speed_DISPLAY_ONLY)
3028 - "dmg bonus vs buildings hidden" (mult_dmg_vs_buildings)
3029 - "keep disguise" (set_keep_disguise)									- You can attack while still disguised and not break disguise! Yes, that includes knives. You better use this responsibly, or ELSE.
3030 - "proximity mines" (mod_sticky_is_proxy)								- Stickybombs explode in close contact, and use the Mine Layer's proximity mine sounds!
3031 - "no sticky detonation" (mod_sticky_no_detonation)					- As it says on the tin, alt-fire doesn't do anything at all. They'll still explode like normal when you shoot more than your max stickies active limit though!
3032 - "sticky fizzles" (mod_sticky_fizzles)								- Trying to detonate stickies results in them harmlessly shattering! Also breaks the sticky into gibs if that's possible on the model, otherwise it just disappears in a quick flash.
3033 - "experimental weapon" (experimental_weapon)							- Okay, this is weird. Essentially, a weapon with this attribute will just redirect you to Stock if you try to equip it. However, IF you have some sort of cvar set, it... um, should let you use it? It might be broken honestly.
3034 - "sentry shoots projectile" (set_sentry_projectile)					- Your sentry shoots nails / dart projectiles that don't seem to harm you. They do the same damage as normal.
3035 - "heal on afterburn" (add_burn_heals)
3036 - "crit vs bleeding players" (crit_vs_bleeding_players)
3037 - "teleporter is jump pad" (set_teleporter_mode)						- Jump pads can't be upgraded, and activate as soon as they finish building. You have 2 of 'em.
3038 - "explosive bullets" (explosive_bullets)								- If set, it'll turn hitscan attacks into "explosive hitscan" - an explosion will happen at the point of impact for one (and only one) pellet. Prior to TF2C v2.1.0, this could also convert hitscan into rocket projectiles with a value of "1", and all pellets were affected, but this is depreciated.
3039 - "airblast cannot push players" (airblast_functionality_flags)		- Complicated, but uses Flags to determine what the Airblast can do. 1: Push Away, 2: Extinguish Teammates, 4: Reflect Projectiles. To get the desired behavior, add these numbers up (IE: "5" gives you an airblast that can push enemies and deflect, but can't extinguish friends).
3040 - "rocket limited lifetime" (rocket_lifetime)							- Projectile has a limited range before it explodes. The value is in seconds traveled before it explodes. Works for Rockets, Tranq Darts, Coils, and Flares (maybe more?)
3041 - "crit vs wet players hidden" (crit_vs_wet_players)
3042 - "move speed bonus while cloaked" (mult_player_movespeed_cloaked)		- You move faster or slower when cloaked!
3043 - "engineer dispenser build rate multiplier" (dispenser_build_rate_multiplier)
3044 - "pda can remote deploy" (pda_remote_deploy)							- When you put down a building, it stays a toolbox. You can start building it by hitting it with a Wrench, or pulling out your PDA and "building" it again. It also automatically starts if it's taking damage.
3045 - "lose cloak on damage" (lose_cloak_on_damage)						- THIS APPLIES TO SELF-DAMAGE OR HEALTH DRAIN TOO!!!
3046 - "heal on hit vs burning" (add_onhit_addhealth_vs_burning)
3047 - "set cloak is speed" (set_weapon_mode)								- You move faster when cloaked! Display text, that is. Set this to "3" for the Speed Watch's unique sounds
3048 - "no damage falloff over distance" (mod_no_dmg_falloff)				- Disables damage falloff, just like it says. HOWEVER, it should be noted damage rampup still exists!
3049 - "add condition on hit" (add_onhit_addcond)							- Adds an AddCond condition to the enemy when you hit 'em. Most existing addconds are beneficial, so not too useful right now. Note; it'll escape onto your other weapons if you don't restrict it!
3050 - "minigun spindown time increased" (mult_minigun_spindown_time)
3051 - "minigun spindown time decreased" (mult_minigun_spindown_time)
3052 - "add construction on hit" (add_onhit_construction)					- When hitting an enemy, your buildings will get upgrade, construction, and / or repair progress, based on how much damage you just dealt and the variable you set. No metal cost at all. NOTE: This WILL escape if you don't prevent it! It bleeds over to EVERY equipped weapon otherwise!
3053 - "copy victim on hit" (mod_onhit_copy_victim)							- When hitting an enemy, you instantly switch over to their class and copy any of their equipped weapons - on the spot. You spawn with full health no matter their or your last health values. Touching resupply will just equip you with your weapons for that class, as normal! When killed, you respawn as a Spy

[v2.0.2]
3054 - "self mark for death alt" (self_mark_for_death_alt)
3055 - "particle on melee hit" (particle_on_melee_hit)						- Spawns another particle on top of the existing hit particle for the melee weapon. Doesn't work for Bottles
3056 - "mark self on miss" (self_mark_for_death_on_miss)
3057 - "civ boost cond override" (add_civ_boost_override)					- Override your boost's effect, follows the same rules as "add_onhit_addcond" for syntax, but where duration values are a percentage of the default Boost duration (A value of 2 means the cond lasts twice as long as a normal boost). Convoluted... but okay??
3058 - "civ boost aura override" (add_civ_aura_override)					- Same deal but for the passive aura around a Civilian
3059 - "civ boost targets enemies" (add_civ_boost_enemies)					- You'll only be able to "boost" enemies instead of teammates - preferably with a detrimental status effect with boost override!

[BROKEN] ???? - "???" (explode_on_damage)									- Unmarked w/ no entry. When you take damage from an enemy, a small explosion happens on-top of you. Does... say, 50-60 dmg, and damages both you and the enemy! NOTE: VERY liable to crash your game! Use 'value_is_additive'-type attribs for splicing.
???? - "???" (mult_dispenser_rate)											- Unmarked w/ no entry. On the Dispenser: Modifies how much more or less ammo people get each tick of standing next to it, and also how much less or more metal it regenerates per tick! Use 'value_is_percentage'-type attribs for splicing.

[v2.1.0]
3060 - "add condition on swing" (add_onswing_addcond)						- Add a cond to yourself on swinging a Melee weapon. Doesn't work on guns!
3061 - "self mark for death on swing" (add_onswing_addcond)
3062 - "self damage penetrates uber" (mod_self_damage_penetrates_uber)		- Any self-damage done to yourself (usually explosions) will damage you even through an active Ubercharge.
3063 - "explode on smack DISPLAY ONLY" (DISPLAY ONLY)
3064 - "mod russian roulette taunt" (mod_russian_roulette_taunt)			- 1/6 chance to kill yourself on using a taunt kill.
3065 - "melee range multiplier increased" (melee_range_multiplier)
3066 - "melee bounds multiplier increased" (melee_bounds_multiplier)
3069 - "mod horizontal spread" (mod_horizontal_spread) 						- Changes pellet "spread" to a straight, horizontal line spreading out from your crosshair. Weird! Doesn't work on Miniguns.
3070 - "apply self knockback" (apply_self_knockback)						- Knock yourself backwards with a certain velocity on firing. Works on most guns, also works with negative values to knock yourself forward. Also works with melees for the "hit" or impact part 
3071 - "apply self knockback on swing" (apply_self_knockback_swing)			- Same as above, but for swinging a Melee weapon!
3072 - "limited range DISPLAY ONLY" (DISPLAY_ONLY)
3073 - "mod mini-crit airborne simple min height" (mini_crit_airborne_simple_min_height) - Self-explanatory, but you can set a custom "effective height" in HU's for the mini-crits to start working.
3074 - "mod crit airborne simple" (crit_airborne_simple)					- Note: As of a recent update this was split. "mod_crit_airborne" is only for blast knockback / jump pads, but "mod_crit_airborne_simple" and variants are for ANY kind of airborne - even jumping!
3075 - "mod crit airborne simple min height" (crit_airborne_simple_min_height)
3076 - "self dmg push force hidden" (mult_dmgself_push_force)
3077 - "custom rampup" (mod_custom_rampup)									- Set a new multiplier value to use for Rampup! Most weapons use 1.5 up close, Scout primaries / beefy hitscan use 1.75, rockets use 1.25, other projectiles usually use 1.2. Otherwise, pipes / flares / sniper rifles usually just use 1.0. Can be set below 1.0 for decreased damage close up (aka inverted rampup)
[SCUFFED] 3078 - "custom falloff" (mod_custom_falloff) 						- Set a new multiplier value to use for Falloff! Most weapons use 0.5 at a distance. Unlike rampup, this seems EXTREMELY inconsistent between weapons, sometimes it works as intended, or only works on the last killing shot, or refuses to work at all. Recommend avoid until fixed... Supplant with "no damage falloff over distance" or "longer damage falloff distance"
3079 - "no knockback on not minicrit or crit" (no_knockback_not_minicrit_crit)
3080 - "banned in medieval mode" (banned_in_medieval_mode)					- Generally only effective for Melee weapons! If you can't equip a certain Melee while in Medieval, then it strips the slot and you run around uselessly in Loser-state. Civilian gaming!
3081 - "ubercharge rate bonus on wearer" (mult_medigun_uberchargerate_wearer)
3082 - "uber duration decreased on wearer" (add_uber_time)
3083 - "uber duration decreased" (add_uber_time_active)
3084 - "cannot use stored crits" (cannot_use_stored_crits)					- A weapon with this attrib can't make use of gain_stored_crits_on_hit's stored crits.
3085 - "gain stored crits on hit" (gain_stored_crits_on_hit)				- Gain 1 'stored crit' on a successful hit with a melee weapon. Crits can be used either by the weapon itself (when full) or any other weapon equipped. Lasts for a second or so for rapid-fire weapons!
3086 - "gain stored crits on kill" (gain_stored_crits_on_kill)
3087 - "custom bullet impact collision mode" (mod_bullet_impact_collision_mode) - Dev Notes: "Works only for bullets. 0 is default, 1 means to use accurate hitboxes, 2 means use collision hulls, 4 is 1 but can pass through teammates, 5 is 2 but can pass through teammates"
3088 - "add condition on kill" (add_onkill_addcond_self)					- Cond on self when you get a kill!
3089 - "gain attack boost on kill" (add_onkill_addcond_self)
3090 - "lose stored crits on miss" (lose_stored_crits_on_miss)				- Depletes 1 stored Crit if you miss.
3091 - "allow reload while cloaked" (mod_can_reload_in_cloak)				- As it says. A not-gameplay-related comment, but... kinda hard to imagine how to reload a weapon with only 1 hand...
3092 - "silent killer no killfeed" (set_silent_killer_no_killfeed)			- Kills don't appear in the kill-feed for enemy players, but the slain players still make screaming noises like usual.
3093 - "buildings max level penalty" (add_buildings_max_level)				- Minimum is Lvl 1, and maximum is Lvl 3.
3094 - "buildings upgrade cost bonus" (add_buildings_upgrade_cost)			- Add or reduce the amount of Metal needed to upgrade a building to the next level. Lower bound is 0 (can upgrade a building by hitting it)
3095 - "add uber charge on hit charge rate modifier" (add_onhit_ubercharge_charge_rate_modifier) - Modifier for add_onhit_ubercharge, makes it scale based on other active Ubercharge rate modifiers! This is a WEAPON attribute, so it has to be on the weapon itself to have an effect!
3096 - "dmg push force to stickies increased hidden" (mult_dmg_push_force_to_stickies) - How much your explosives knock enemy Stickies around.
3097 - "always crits on full stored crits" (always_crit_full_stored_crits)	- When at max stored crit capacity, you'll always do critical hits with this weapon. Best used with lose stored on miss.
3098 - "melee taken becomes crit on active" (melee_taken_becomes_crit_active) - Note that most classes will do 195 DMG on a crit-melee swing assuming no other modifiers. If you use it, expect the wielder to instantly die unless they're overhealed, a Heavy, or full-health Soldier
3099 - "melee taken becomes crit on wearer" (melee_taken_becomes_crit_wearer)
3100 - "melee taken becomes minicrit on active" (melee_taken_becomes_minicrit_active)
3101 - "melee taken becomes minicrit on wearer" (melee_taken_becomes_minicrit_wearer)
3102 - "cannot use stored crits hidden" (cannot_use_stored_crits)			- As it says on the tin. Put this on support weapons that aren't really supposed to use Stored Crits or that make no sense to be visually critboosted (like the Sandvich)
3103 - "cloak blink time percentage penalty" (cloak_blink_time_penalty)
3104 - "damage flat penalty" (mult_dmg)										- Modifiers to add or remove damage by a flat number instead of percentage-based (+10 or -10 dmg, for instance)
3105 - "damage flat bonus" (mult_dmg)
3106 - "crits vs class" (crit_vs_class)										- FYI this is COMPLETELY unconditional, so use as a joke only sparingly (or not at all). Uses bitflags to determine what classes it works against...
3107 - "minicrits vs class" (minicrit_vs_class)								- (Mini-)Crit damage text will also only show up if an attack does at least 1 DMG, so it can't be used as a free detector for a certain class. Not that you even SHOULD do that, god.
3108 - "minicrit vs wet players" (minicrit_vs_wet_players)
3109 - "crit vs player under feet" (crit_vs_player_under_feet)				- Occurs if you're above their head under any circumstance - explosive jump, regular jump, or even standing on top of them. Can be a little finnicky at times...
3110 - "minicrit vs player under feet" (minicrit_vs_player_under_feet)
3111 - "minicrit while disguised" (minicrit_while_disguised)				- Will work on the shot / swing that breaks disguise, too. Also works with "that" attribute, but just behave yourselves, okay? Yikes.
3112 - "minicrit take while disguised" (minicrit_take_while_disguised)		- Applies the ENTIRE time you're disguised, pretty steep downside unless you're pairing it with a pretty steep upside.
3113 - "minicrit on disguise removed" (minicrit_on_disguise_removed)
3114 - "remove targets afterburn on death" (on_death_remove_targets_afterburn) - If YOU die, any active afterburn you dealt to enemies is removed preemptively.
3115 - "flat heal on afterburn on active" (flat_heal_on_afterburn_active)
3116 - "flat heal on afterburn on wearer" (flat_heal_on_afterburn_wearer)
3117 - "burn dmg reduced on active" (mult_burndmg_active)
3118 - "burn dmg increased on active" (mult_burndmg_active)
3119 - "burn dmg reduced on wearer" (mult_burndmg_wearer)
3120 - "burn dmg increased on wearer" (mult_burndmg_wearer)
3121 - "remember targets remaining afterburn" (remember_targets_afterburn) 	- Very weird attrib. Uhh.. if the enemy dies with active afterburn, if you say got some sort of effect from each afterburn tick (heals, or a cond applied to you), then that keeps happening even after they're clearly dead and afterburn SHOULD be over?
3122 - "special sound on afterburn heal attempt" (afterburn_heal_attempt_sound)	- Sound that plays for above when it's valid...?
3123 - "health kits can overheal on wearer" (health_kits_can_overheal_wearer) - As it says. It SHOULD be noted that you can pick up any healthkits so long as you aren't at full Overheal (always). Use responsibly...
3124 - "health kits can overheal on active" (health_kits_can_overheal_active)
3125 - "health from packs increased on active" (mult_health_frompacks_active)
3126 - "health from packs decreased on active" (mult_health_frompacks_active)

3141 - "dispenser healing received on active penalty" (mult_dispenser_healing_received_active)
3142 - "dispenser can overheal on wearer" (dispenser_can_overheal_wearer)
3143 - "dispenser can overheal on active" (dispenser_can_overheal_active)	- Very neat, but should be used sparingly since it's basically free overheal as long as a Dispenser exists.
3144 - "everything can overheal on wearer" (everything_can_overheal_wearer)
3145 - "everything can overheal on active" (everything_can_overheal_active) - Includes: Medics, Dispensers (+ Payload), Health Kits, negative dmg trigger_hurt! Possibly more, idk.
3146 - "crit vs cond no dot" (single_crit_vs_playercond_no_dot)				- Crits vs. any addcond - input is the cond to check against (but add 1 to the result number)! Also isn't affected by any Damage-over-Time effects (like afterburn or bleed). Useful.
3148 - "minicrit vs cond no dot" (single_minicrit_vs_playercond_no_dot)
3151 - "instant reload on direct hit" (instant_reload_on_direct_hit)
3152 - "instant reload on hit" (instant_reload_on_hit)						- When hitting an enemy, "reloads" a variable amount of ammo into your active gun immediately with no delay.

3163 - "tranq on hit VISUAL ONLY PART 2" (VISUALONLY)
3164 - "cannot pickup dropped weapons while cloaked" (cannot_pickup_dropped_weapons_while_cloaked)
3165 - "cannot pickup ammo packs while cloaked" (cannot_pickup_ammo_packs_while_cloaked)
3166 - "medkits cannot overheal unless injured modifier" (health_kits_cannot_overheal_unless_injured_modifier) - To be used with one of the above overheal attrs, to discourage camping over a medkit to "top-up". You won't be able to pick up a healthkit unless you're actually below maxhealth. This DOESN'T work if you picked up health kits because of "everything can overheal on wearer"
3167 - "primary ammo from ammo packs bonus" (mult_primary_ammo_from_ammo_packs)
3168 - "primary ammo from ammo packs penalty" (mult_primary_ammo_from_ammo_packs)
3169 - "primary ammo from dropped weapons bonus" (mult_primary_ammo_from_dropped_weapons)

3175 - "bullet is a hull" (bullet_is_a_hull)								- Basically, makes your hitscan bullets fire out a variable-size "box-hull" I think - think of it like firing a really fast, invisible rocket that travels instantly from Point A to B. Var changes the size of the hull, cubed (2.0 makes a 2x2x2 box-hull!)
3176 - "instant reload all weapons on direct hit" (instant_reload_all_weapons_on_direct_hit)
3177 - "instant reload all weapons on hit" (instant_reload_all_weapons_on_hit) - When hitting an enemy, fully reload all weapons currently equipped - probably to be used only on melee weps!

3179 - "instant reload all weapons on kill" (instant_reload_all_weapons_on_kill)
3180 - "apply weapon damage boost on kill" (apply_weapon_damage_boost_on_kill) - Basically a mini-crit boost, but applies only to the weapon itself - even if you try to switch to another weapon.
3181 - "dmg taken from burning target reduced on active" (mult_dmgtaken_from_burning_target_active)
3182 - "no knockback on not airborne" (no_knockback_not_airborne)			- Think the deal is like, only deals knockback on enemies that aren't grounded (so no knocking people into the air) / possibly also only works on weps that are able to already do knockback?
[SCUFFED] 3182 - "no knockback on not airborne and not minicrit or crit" (no_knockback_not_airborne_and_not_minicrit_crit) - Um... this takes up the same ID. Is this supposed to be 3183? 'Cuz, it's not.
3184 - "self knockback affected by damage boost modifier" (self_knockback_damage_boost_modifier) - FOR "apply_self_knockback" AND VARIANTS ONLY - if you have a damage boost of some kind (civ boost, kritz), then scale your self-knockback accordingly. Very strong, but also very situational...
3185 - "lose cloak on decloak" (lose_cloak_on_decloak)						- Lose a variable amount of cloak when you decloak prematurely.
3186 - "attributes no trigger on DOT modifier" (attributes_no_DOT_trigger_modifier) - I honestly have no clue what this does. I have to guess it has to do with DoT effects... somehow??
3187 - "smoke bomb on full cloak" (smoke_bomb_on_full_cloak)				- When you cloak at 100% Cloak, it spawns some smoke particles around you and makes you fully cloak instantly and applies invuln for a variable time. Below 100% cloak, it works as usual.
3188 - "no primary ammo from dispensers" (no_primary_ammo_from_dispensers_always) - Even when you don't have your Primary weapon equipped when hugging a Dispenser, you are unable to get primary ammo from it at all.
3189 - "HIDDEN primary ammo from ammo packs penalty" (mult_primary_ammo_from_ammo_packs)
3190 - "HIDDEN primary ammo from dropped weapons penalty" (mult_primary_ammo_from_dropped_weapons)
3191 - "sentry target override on hit" (sentry_target_override_on_hit)		- Forces your sentry to shoot at a target instead of any others, when you shoot them with this! Works beyond normal Sentry range, and sentry will keep shooting until it loses focus. Doesn't work through walls!
3192 - "outline target on hit" (outline_on_hit)								- Draws an team-colored outline around a target on hit for a variable amount of time. I think it's visible to everyone? It also gets applied to enemy buildings too, if you hit those... (?????) Doesn't work if you have glow effects disabled, though.
3195 - "residual heal rate" (residual_heal_rate)
3196 - "residual heal duration" (residual_heal_duration)
3197 - "set damage for knockback" (set_damage_knockback)					- Only deal knockback if the weapon does more than a specified amount of damage at once.
3198 - "apply heal on explosion" (apply_heal_explosion)						- Heals people who you hit or are caught in explosions! ONLY works for explosives or hitscan emitted by TF_Weapon_PaintBallRifle!
3199 - "reduce healing on indirect hit" (apply_heal_explosion_reduced_indirect)
[BROKEN] 3200 - "explode on touch world" (explode_on_impact) 				- A bit buggy, supposed to make grenades blow up instantly when colliding with the world. If you're looking to use this, look at "set_detonate_mode" instead.
3201 - "anti gravity boots" (anti_gravity_boots)							- When active, gives you a bit of a 'strange' double-jump; it reverses your CURRENT vertical velocity once per jump! Using it while jumping up will crater you to the ground, but using it while falling will throw you upwards! Does NOT work on Scout.
3202 - "mod min cloak to activate" (mod_min_cloak_to_activate)
3203 - "no ammo hidden" (energy_weapon_no_ammo)
3204 - "medigun charge is push buff" (set_charge_type)						- Supposedly, changes your Uber to dmg resistance and minicrits, maybe more unlisted stuff... Seems finnicky...
3205 - "mod min cloak to activate HIDDEN" (mod_min_cloak_to_activate)
3206 - "bullets per shot penalty" (mult_bullets_per_shot)
3207 - "return metal on sentry kill" (metal_on_sentry_kill)					- When your Sentry gets any kind of kill, gives you back a variable amount of Metal.
3208 - "blast splash damage increased" (mult_explosion_splash_damage) 		- ONLY affects splash damage - does absolutely nothing to impact / direct-hit damage. WORKS FOR TF_WEAPON_DETONATOR!!
3209 - "blast splash damage decreased" (mult_explosion_splash_damage)
3210 - "engy sentry radius increased target overriden" (mult_sentry_range_overriden) - Modifies Sentry target range for marked enemies via "sentry_target_override_on_hit". Also, yes, that is a typo.
3211 - "no explosion falloff hidden" (disable_explosion_falloff)
3212 - "uber build bonus on hit" (uber_build_rate_on_hit)					- Modifies your Ubercharge accumulation rate - but doesn't actually give you any Uber. You'll still have to get the Uber by healing! The final rate increase is what you'd put as the number, the game divides that by 8 for the stacks mechanic I think?
3213 - "uses ammo meter with passive loading" (use_ammo_meter)				- Switches the weapon over to a unique "meter" reload - when you fire the weapon, it depletes ammo and a meter refills over time passively. Once it does, it increments your ammo count as if you reloaded normally! The meter will refill independent of your actions a-la Item Meter recharges.
3214 - "explode on world" (set_detonate_mode)
3215 - "ubercharge rate penalty on wearer" (mult_medigun_uberchargerate_wearer)
[BROKEN] 3216 - "backpack heal targets limit" (backpack_patient_limit)		- SUPPOSED to enforce a limit to amount of patients able to be healed at once by your Healing Backpack - doesn't seem to work at all...
3217 - "weapon range decreased" (mult_weapon_range)							- The description and name of this is REALLY unclear and generic. This works to extend Medigun range, at least? I'm unsure if it does anything else, but it DOES work for Medigun1
3218 - "weapon range increased" (mult_weapon_range)
3219 - "multi heal rate penalty" (mult_medigun_healrate_multiple_targets)
3220 - "ubercharge rate penalty multi heal" (mult_medigun_uberchargerate_wearer_multiheal)
3221 - "medigun backpack range decreased" (mult_backpack_range)				- Sets the effective range of your healing backpack as a multiplier.
3222 - "no crit heals" (crit_heals_disabled)								- Being Critboosted or Minicritboosted doesn't affect your healing output or uber gain.
3223 - "medigun backpack range decreased hidden" (mult_backpack_range)
3224 - "ubercharge rate penalty multi heal hidden" (mult_medigun_uberchargerate_wearer_multiheal)
3225 - "multi heal rate penalty hidden" (mult_medigun_healrate_multiple_targets)
3226 - "no crit heals hidden" (crit_heals_disabled)
[BROKEN] 3227 - "no backpack overheal" (backpack_no_overheal)
3228 - "modifier crit airborne direct hit only" (mod_crit_airborne_direct_hit_only)
3229 - "modifier mini crit airborne direct hit only" (mod_minicrit_airborne_direct_hit_only)
3230 - "no ubercharge display only" (no_uber_display)
3231 - "medigun backpack range increased" (mult_backpack_range)
3232 - "hide extra wearable on active" (hide_extra_wearable_active)			- If the weapon has an Extra Wearable, hide it when the weapon is actively equipped! Might be useful for "holstering" certain high-importance weaponry...
3233 - "marked target autoheal duration" (marked_target_autoheal_duration)	- HEALING BACKPACK!! If you hit your allies (with TF_Weapon_PaintBallRifle + some other attribs), then you spawn a beam that emits from you to them and heals them, for some amount of time. All those other BP attributes rely on this!
3234 - "marked target autoheal rate" (marked_target_autoheal_rate)
3235 - "sentry turn rate bonus overriden" (mult_sentry_turnrate_overriden)
[BROKEN] 3236 - "explode on death" (explode_on_death) 						- NOT cosmetic! Think of it like the Martyrdom perk in CoD - you explode after being killed and deal massive damage.
3237 - "take minicrits from projectile during blast jump" (take_minicrits_projectile_blast_jump)
3238 - "take crits from projectile during blast jump" (take_crits_projectile_blast_jump)
3239 - "deflect on smack hidden" (deflect_on_smack)							- When hitting an active projectile with your Melee directly, deflect it back, similar to an Airblast!
3240 - "deflect on swing" (deflect_on_swing)								- Same as above, but for swinging your weapon.
3241 - "bullet deflect duration on swing" (bullet_deflect_duration_on_swing) - I'd normally say something helpful, but I have absolutely no idea what this does even AFTER testing. Are you supposed to deflect hitscan bullets???
3242 - "airblast no players" (disable_airblasting_players)					- Directly forces airblast not to push people!
3243 - "marked targets take extra healing" (marked_target_bonusheal_duration)
3244 - "scoped firerate penalty" (mult_postfiredelay_scoped)				- Fire rate stuff that works on scoped shots! Completely independent of the normal Fire Rate modifiers. With low-enough fire rates (about 0.33 works), then you can fire fast enough to not unscope between shots!
3245 - "Projectile speed increased hidden" (mult_projectile_speed)
3246 - "soft zoom hidden" (mod_sniper_soft_zoom)
3247 - "no scope hidden" (mod_no_scope)
3248 - "override projectile type scoped" (override_projectile_type_zoomed)	- While zoomed in with any kind of Sniper Rifle, your fired shots will be set to a variable projectile.
3249 - "hitscan hits allies" (hitscan_hits_allies)							- Doesn't do damage, no. Just makes it so your hitscan, well, literally hits allies, a-la Melee hitting allies.
3250 - "silent killer no scream" (set_silent_killer_no_scream)				- Killed players don't make any noise. Can be used in conjunction with silent_killer_no_killfeed to get 2/3 of the original effect! For now, can supplement the corpse thing with ragdolls become ash...
3251 - "sentries no aggro" (sentries_no_aggro)								- Sentries completely ignore you unless you do any sort of attack, generally. They are "alerted" for about 3s after any attack of yours. Ducking in and out of cover will reset their aggro! A bit yikes to use IMO
3252 - "burning targets charge crit DISPLAY ONLY" (burn_targets_charge_crit_DISPLAY_ONLY)
[BROKEN] 3253 - "streak adds damage bonus DISPLAY ONLY" (streak_adds_damage_bonus_DISPLAY_ONLY)	- The weapon it belonged to seems to have been removed, but tf2c_english seems to imply this adds damage on a direct hit. Modifiable?
3254 - "heal on smack DISPLAY ONLY" (heal_on_smack_DISPLAY_ONLY)
3255 - "wearable add cond on right click" (add_wearable_cond_on_secondary_attack) - ONLY WEARABLES RN: If you have the wearable, and you're on a weapon that doesn't have a right-click action, then right-click adds a cond to you. Same as other addcond commands - except one more var at the end that's for how long recharge is (seconds)
3256 - "wearable cond on effect percent" (add_wearable_cond_on_effect_percent) - If you're still in "right-click" state from above, then after a certain percent is left, activate ANOTHER cond! Same dealio.
3257 - "set shield bash damage" (add_set_shield_bash_damage)				- Set value for your bash-damage if charging! If you want it to do 50 DMG bashes, set the number to "51". I guess it adds 1 for some reason...
3258 - "shield bash aoe knockback" (add_shield_bash_aoe_knockback)
3259 - "mult shield bash damage" (mult_shield_bash_damage)					- Multiplier for shield bash damage instead, if you wanna use that. The default value at "1" seems to be 50 DMG.
3260 - "blast splash damage decreased hidden" (mult_explosion_splash_damage)
3261 - "blast dmg to self increased hidden" (blast_dmg_to_self)
3262 - "damage penalty hidden" (mult_dmg)
3263 - "crit on objective" (crit_on_objectives)								- While you or an enemy are "contributing" toward an Objective (Standing near a Control Point, Payload, or VIP, attacking an enemy VIP, or carrying Intel), you'll do (hidden) crits!
3264 - "minicrit on objective" (mini_crit_on_objectives)
3265 - "sapper is radar" (sapper_is_radar)									- Turn your sapper into a handheld radar! While active, it shows you nearby enemy outlines in a variable radius around you, even through walls. Note; you can STILL sap buildings by default - so adding this alone is just an upgrade to stock! Also, I don't know if the outlines are only for you or for everyone on your team...
3266 - "bomblets count mod mult hidden" (bomblets_count_mod)				- Modifier for how many Bomblets appear when a MIRV explodes! Multiplicative of the base amount (0.3 will create only one bomblet, and 10.0 will create 30 bomblets! - can also be used to spawn no bomblets at all)
3269 - "spawn entity on detonation" (spawn_entity_on_detonation)			- It does exactly as it says - spawns an arbitrary entity on explosion. Weird!! Only works for Pill Grenades and MIRV. Note: I don't think the spawned entity shows up with any KeyValues at all, so keep that in mind. Stuff will NOT have a team and could crash the game!
3270 - "apply cond on pickup wearer" (apply_cond_on_pickup_wearer)			- When you pick up a healthkit spawned by prev attrib, apply some conds? This has really weird syntax - it's a bitflag and THEN the usual cond stuff. Bitflags are... 1: Yourself, 2: Teammates, 4: Enemies, 8: Switch behavior w/ Disguises
3271 - "mirv drag mod mult hidden" (mirv_drag_mod)							- Modifies the air drag force on a MIRV when thrown! Doesn't work on any other physics projectiles (Pills, Stickies)
3272 - "weapon enemy knockback mod mult increased" (weapon_enemy_knockback_mod) - Modifier for how powerful weapon knockback is! This affects BASE knockback and stacks with any further stuff, like via attrib. Note it won't be obvious when shooting targets since wep. knockback has lots of variation with angle, damage, "ground friction", and other bull.
3273 - "weapon enemy knockback mod mult decreased" (weapon_enemy_knockback_mod)
3274 - "movespeed mult active penalty" (mult_player_movespeed_active)
3275 - "sentry hit chance when shield charging mult" (sentry_hit_chance_shield_charge) - I guess a percent chance for sentrygun fire to miss when it would normally hit if you're charging with the cond.. this is kinda weird?
3276 - "heal on owner health pickup instead of recharge" (heal_on_owned_health_pickup_no_recharge) - Functionally only for TF_Weapon_Lunchbox throwables, but if you otherwise emit any health pickup that belongs to you, then touching it heals you + consumes the item on the ground, instead of recharging your item meter.
3277 - "punch angle mod mult hidden" (punch_angle_mod)						- These seem to modify the "recoil" effect when shooting a gun - the screen-shake that happens when you fire something!
3278 - "punch angle mod add hidden" (punch_angle_mod)
3279 - "punch angle is constant" (punch_angle_is_constant)
3280 - "mirv detonate with rocket radius" (mirv_detonate_with_rocket_radius) - A VERY weird one. If you throw a MIRV, then it'll detonate when you shoot a rocket projectile at it??? Var defines the radius for the rocket to show up to explode. Also works for Pipebombs and Bricks! However, it'll only work for your own projectiles. Enemies shooting at it with their own rockets can't trigger it.
3281 - "no headshot" (no_headshot)											- On Sniper Rifles / Bows, you aren't able to headshot at all even if you hit their head like normal. However, damage charge naturally still works if present on the weapon!
3282 - "can headshot" (can_headshot)										- On most hitscan weapons, if your damage lands in the head hitbox - whatever hit there crits! No need to scope to deal crit damage. Does NOT work for melees or any projectiles. Also doesn't work for explosive hitscan...
3283 - "headshot is minicrit" (headshot_is_minicrit)						- This is an innate part of Minicrits, but just remember headshots at range will also be affected by falloff. Minicrits still have falloff, full crits don't.
3284 - "dmg taken from fall reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fall)
3285 - "dmg taken from fall increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fall)			- Oof owie my bones
3286 - "earthquake attack wearer" (earthquake_attack_wearer) 				- When you take fall damage, emit a kinda shockwave that does damage! Can modify radial distance(?), base damage(??), and multiplier from fall damage. It also makes that annoying sound EVERY time you fall. Um, haha.
3287 - "earthquake attack active" (earthquake_attack_active)
3288 - "gravity mod wearer increased" (gravity_mod_wearer)
3289 - "gravity mod wearer reduced" (gravity_mod_wearer)					- While the weapon / item is equipped, "modifies" your active gravity - for higher or lower jumps, or faster / slower falling! DOES work with negative values for unconditional flight!!!!
3290 - "gravity mod active increased" (gravity_mod_active)					- Same as above, but only while active
3291 - "gravity mod active reduced" (gravity_mod_active)
3292 - "lunchbox add condition on eat" (lunchbox_addcond)					- FINALLY, LUNCHBOX ADDCONDS! Important note; the healing from Sandvich-based stuff DOES cancel medigun uber / kritz conds - so you have to use unconditional crits / ubers if you want them to not wear off immediately. Also, nothing stops you from sitting and spamming it. Fair warning...
3293 - "building add condition on death" (building_maxlvl_lost_addcond)		- When an enemy destroys any Lvl. 3 building of yours, apply a cond to yourself! It needs to be an enemy that does it - building deaths from any other source doesn't trigger anything.
3294 - "mod mini-crit simple airborne" (mini_crit_airborne_simple)
3295 - "mod crit airborne" (crit_airborne)
3296 - "engy building health penalty" (mult_engy_building_health)
3297 - "engy sentry damage penalty" (mult_engy_sentry_damage)
3298 - "health regen delay time when damaged" (mod_health_regen_hurt_delay)	- I think this modifies the time in seconds before your passive HP regen kicks in after taking any damage
3299 - "proxy mine detection radius increased" (mult_proxymine_radius)
3300 - "proxy mine detection radius decreased" (mult_proxymine_radius)
3301 - "proxy mine detonation time decreased" (mult_proxymine_detonate_time) - Similar to above, a proxymine still uses the "activation" sound at the same time as normal but there'll be a different delay before exploding - faster or (usually) slower!
3302 - "proxy mine detonation time increased" (mult_proxymine_detonate_time)
3303 - "proxy mine no sound" (mod_proxymine_no_sound)
3304 - "engy sentry knockback bonus" (mult_sentry_knockback)				- Works about how you expect, can also do negative knockback numbers if you're a sadist
3305 - "engy sentry knockback penalty" (mult_sentry_knockback)
3306 - "engy sentry turn rate bonus" (mult_sentry_turnrate)					- Adjusts your Sentry's turn-rate globally - the speed at which it turns toward targets, that is!
3307 - "engy sentry turn rate penalty" (mult_sentry_turnrate)
3308 - "sapper cant sap" (sapper_cant_sap)									- Even disables the console command to manually build!
3309 - "sapper damages self" (sapper_damages_self)							- After being applied, the Sapper does a variable amount of damage to itself over time as it saps the building - higher values mean the faster it gets destroyed. It works with negatives for healing sappers, but the Sapper still breaks after a only a few hits no matter what (thank god)
3310 - "grenade cook detonation time mult" (grenade_cook_detonation_time_mult)
3311 - "chekhov punch VISUAL ONLY CRIT ONLY AT FULL CAPACITY" (VISUALONLY)
3313 - "mod taunt kill fill stored crits" (mod_taunt_kill_fill_stored_crits) - As it says on the tin, getting a taunt-kill with something that can hold stored Crits will fill it all the way up on a successful kill!
3314 - "mod melee crit swing custom damage" (mod_melee_crit_swing_custom_damage) - KILL EFFECTS!! When you get a critical kill with a melee weapon, you can apply some kind of effect to it. Not bitflags, but I've provided a short list in the bitflags section!
3315 - "override mult deploy weapon time animation" (override_mult_deploy_time_anim) - Helpful override to change how much faster or slower the viewmodel draw anim is, on-top of any existing draw speed modifiers. Usually to fix awkward-lookin anims if you don't wanna touch the model!

[v2.1.2]
3316 - "brick mini-crit long range" (mod_brick_minicrit_over_time)			- Need to test more, but input value seems to be in seconds it needs to travel before it does Minicrit damage! Unsure if it applies to more than Brick proj yet...

???? - "no centerfire projectile" (no_centerfire_projectile)				- Formerly was ID 4083, its entry was removed. Forces this weapon to never centerfire, even when "tf2c_centerfire_preference" is set to 1. Use 'value_is_additive'-type attribs for splicing.
???? - "???" (lunchbox_force_cooldown)										- Unmarked w/ no entry. For Lunchbox items, forces them to be used up after consumption. Use 'value_is_additive'-type attribs for splicing.

[Extra Attributes by azzy - v2.1.3]
4000 - "minigun deployed crouchwalk" (minigun_deployed_crouchwalk)			- You can crouchwalk while a Minigun is deployed! As it is, just defaults to the regular un-revved crouchwalk anims for it (which work surprisingly well!). Not terribly useful since you move ungodly slow, but it helps a bit.
4001 - "not crit vs burning flare" (not_crit_vs_burning_flare)				- Flares projectiles shot by your weapon don't crit burning targets! Finally.
4002 - "apply self knockback airblast" (apply_self_knockback_airblast)		- When airblasting, apply a variable self-knockback force to yourself, for "airblast jumps" or the like! Works like the previously discussed self knockback.
4003 - "minigun jump while revved" (minigun_jump_while_revved)				- You can jump while a Minigun is deployed! There's no special / working animation for it, or being airborne with a Minigun, but it's the thought that counts. Use this wisely, since a smart Heavy can use this to effectively negate his move speed penalties!!
4004 - "mod sniper zoom while jumping" (mod_sniper_zoom_while_jumping)		- You can jump while scoped in with a Sniper Rifle! Nothing to say, it just feels right. Also works for Bows!
4005 - "brick explodes" (brick_explode)										- For TF_Projectile_Brick, instead of disappearing into thin air, they detonate like a regular pipe bomb! They still have no visual timer for such, though. Also, FYI, default fuse time for Bricks seems to be 10s flat, if you need to modify it!
4006 - "burning targets always charge crit" (beacon_always_store_crits)
4007 - "heal on kill on crit beacon" (heal_on_kill_crit)					- Best used for melees with either very high random crit rates (higher than normal I mean), or guaranteed crits that trigger from stuff (a-la TF_Weapon_Beacon)
4008 - "heal on kill on crit" (heal_on_kill_crit)
4009 - "mod beacon max ticks" (mod_beacon_max_ticks)
4010 - "clipsize increase on kill cap" (clipsize_increase_on_kill_cap)		- A limiter for "clipsize_increase_on_kill"! How much clipsize to add before stopping...
4016 - "rocket whistle" (rocket_whistle)									- For gravity-rockets, causes them to also whistle as they fly! You can set a very very low grav if you wanna use this for straight-flying rockets. Used to be tied to the "rocket gravity" attrib prior to TF2C v2.1.0, but it isn't anymore!
4017 - "chargeweapon no extra speed" (chargeweapon_no_extra_speed)			- As advertised! Charging doesn't make your projectiles go any faster - helpful in certain scenarios
4018 - "grenade cook" (grenade_cook)										- As implied. If able to charge a projectile, then charging also reduces fuse time when it's eventually thrown. If fully charged, it explodes in your face!
4019 - "custom projectile origin offset" (custom_projectile_origin_offset)	- Change the xyz spawning origin of your projectiles manually, relative to your player origin. In layman's terms; how far away (x), how much to the side (y), how much up / down (z), The attribute entry lists some numbers for base projectiles... Also, I'm unsure how it displays to other clients. Hmm.
4020 - "mod explosive bullet delay time" (mod_explosive_bullet_delay_time)	- Very weird... for explosive hitscan bullets, this delays the time they actually explode. But, it also delays the time they do damage, too. So, you can have a weird situation where you hit someone, do no damage, and it takes a moment to explode.
4021 - "set watch is speed VISUAL ONLY" (set_watch_is_speed_VISUAL_ONLY)
4022 - "lifesteal" (lifesteal)												- Slightly different than the Kunai - this heals you for any damage you do, period! Heals are 1-1 to damage, it also caps at your usual overheal cap. It's also general, so it works on guns (it is VERY overpowered on those though, use wisely please)
4023 - "lifesteal crit" (lifesteal_crit)									- As above, but for crits only. This would be "closer" to how the Kunai works, more or less.
4024 - "stickies dont stick" (stickies_dont_stick)							- As it says, Stickybombs won't stick to surfaces and will just kinda act like a normal physics object (like Pipes) until you decide to blow them up yourself. Works with Proxymines too. Fair warning, these are pretty inconsistent for traps unless you use a model that doesn't roll around that much.
4025 - "melee range multiplier crit" (melee_range_multiplier_crit)			- Same as normal but only for crit swings. Honestly, not really sure what to think about it...
4026 - "mod use custom ammo type" (mod_use_custom_ammo_type)				- A MUCH more versatile / sensible version of "mod_use_metal_ammo_type"! Uses variables 1-5 to set a weapon's ammo type to Primary, Secondary, Metal, Grenade1, and Grenade2 ammo, respectively. Note that a class' default ammo for these types differ and might be weird.
4027 - "maxammo grenades2 increased" (mult_maxammo_grenades2)
4028 - "mod dispenser cost" (mod_dispenser_cost)							- Independent modifiers for Building Costs! Teleporter already has one grandfathered in, so these are for all the remaining buildings.
4029 - "mod sentrygun cost" (mod_sentrygun_cost)
4030 - "mod jumppad cost" (mod_jumppad_cost)
4031 - "mod coilgun explode time" (mod_coilgun_explode_time)
4032 - "custom lunchbox throwable type" (custom_lunchbox_throwable_type)	- Set what kind of health kit a throwable Sandvich emits! 1, 2, and 3 are small, medium (default), and large, respectively! If you don't set this at all, it defaults to medium health kit
4033 - "custom lunchbox throwable model" (custom_lunchbox_throwable_model)	- CUSTOM MODEL OVERRIDE FOR SANDVICHES!! Took long enough... HOWEVER, Lunchbox Throwables aren't teamcolored yet!
4034 - "mult lunchbox throwable velocity" (mult_lunchbox_throwable_velocity)
4035 - "mod coil max bounces" (mod_coil_max_bounces)						- Additive for amount of times coilgun lasers bounce! Works as you'd expect, value is how much more or less times it bounces. Note: Their damage is reduced more for every time they bounce before hitting a target, as before.
4036 - "apply self knockback hidden" (apply_self_knockback)
4037 - "weapon enemy knockback mod mult hidden" (weapon_enemy_knockback_mod)
4038 - "single wep deploy time hidden" (mult_single_wep_deploy_time)
4039 - "mod mini-crit airborne hidden" (mini_crit_airborne)
4040 - "mod mini-crit airborne simple min height hidden" (mini_crit_airborne_simple_min_height)
4041 - "mod mini-crit airborne on direct DISPLAY ONLY" (DISPLAY_ONLY)
4042 - "modifier mini crit airborne direct hit only hidden" (mod_minicrit_airborne_direct_hit_only)
4043 - "lifesteal crit beacon" (lifesteal_crit_beacon)
4044 - "mult melee smack delay" (mult_melee_smack_delay)					- General modifier! Modifies the delay between swinging a melee weapon and actually hitting something. Works to make it shorter as-is. Lengthening the time is buggy, you'll have to splice it to be additive to have that work! (for all melees; also includes Spy Knife). Use an additive value of 0.2 for Spy knives
4045 - "always draw tracer" (mod_always_draw_tracer_effect)					- Most hitscan weapons don't always show a tracer for every pellet, so this makes it so they do!
4046 - "mod ammo per reload" (mod_ammo_per_reload)							- Additive modifier for how much ammo is reloaded per reloading action - if you set it to 1, that means 1 additional ammo is loaded and decremented whenever you do a reloading action (for multi reloads)
4047 - "mult taser heal scale" (mult_taser_heal_scale)						- MODIFIER FOR TF_WEAPON_TASER HEALING!! Modifies the percentage of health the patient is healed by on a successful hit - ideally, lower, since by default it fully overheals a patient.
4048 - "mod taser damage noscale" (mod_taser_damage_noscale)				- As above. Your melee damage is no longer affected by your current charge. This still depletes your charge on hit, though.
4049 - "mod building upgrade full metal only" (mod_building_upgrade_full_metal_only) - When hitting a building while active, it won't get upgrade progress at all even if you have metal and it's able. When you have full metal, though (200 by default), then hitting the building will use all 200 at once and upgrade it instantly. Unsure of behavior with other players...
4050 - "hide ammo hud" (hide_ammo_hud)										- Hides your ammo display if your weapon has one. Best used where ammo management isn't really a problem!
4051 - "set watch panel" (set_watch_panel)									- Watch VGUI panel modifier! It's just a toggle - 1 sets it to a circular-shaped meter (this decrements in notches instead of continuously)
4052 - "mod sniper zoom fov override" (mod_sniper_zoom_fov_override)		- Works as expected! However, even works with really high FOV values (which pull your view backwards), and even negative values (just imagine it). Generally, the default FoV for just standing around is 90, if you want an imperceptible scope-in!
4053 - "custom hand viewmodel" (custom_hand_viewmodel)						- Override for your viewmodel arms themselves!! Enter a model path and it'll load it instead of the normal class arms. NOTE, this is affected by provide on active, so plan ahead! It's also not affected by critglows, seemingly intentionally. Hm.
4054 - "no melee crit from tranq" (no_melee_crit_from_tranq)				- If present on a melee, a player won't be able to use it to melee-crit against Tranq'd players. Applies to yourself, too, if you were the one that tranq'd and you have this, obviously.
4055 - "hidden separator" (hidden_separator)								- An INTERESTING one!! This is a meta-attribute, it'll HIDE all attributes that show up beneath it, in order. Useful for if you wanna hide lots of stats and don't wanna wrangle with attribute splicing for all of 'em. However, it counts as one attribute in itself, and weapons have an 18-attrib limit before causing issues. FYI!
4056 - "mod explosion no owner check" (mod_explosion_no_owner_check)		- For explosions created by yourself, completely ignores any innate resists / conditionals tied to the blast. For instance, a Soldier with this would fly VERY far and take a lot of damage from his Rockets by default!
4057 - "never draw tracer" (mod_never_draw_tracer_effect)					- As it says on the tin. Also applies to critical hitscan shots, so all good there.
4058 - "mirv impact" (mirv_impact)											- If set, throwing a TF_Weapon_Grenade_Mirv_Projectile will make it do damage if it hits someone before landing! Only applies to the main bomb (as far as I can tell)
4059 - "mult mirv impact damage" (mult_mirv_impact_damage)
4060 - "chekhov punch VISUAL ONLY STORE 3 CRITS" (VISUALONLY)
4061 - "chekhov punch VISUAL ONLY CRITS CONSUMED BY ALL WEAPONS" (VISUALONLY)
4062 - "add condition on hit weapon" (add_onhit_addcond_weapon)				- For addcond effects, only applies on the weapon itself that has said addcond effect! Should be default behavior tbh...
4063 - "add condition on hit self" (add_onhit_addcond_self)					- When you hit someone, add a condition onto yourself! Existed at least since TF2C v2.0.2, but was unlisted.
4064 - "add condition on hit self weapon" (add_onhit_addcond_self_weapon)
4065 - "custom view punch on hit" (add_custom_viewpunch_onhit)				- Apparently, it accepts a 6 value input, a min and max respectively for pitch, yaw, and roll, and it'll select randomly between those when applying viewpunch to enemies...?

4066 - "mod launched cond no stomp" (mod_launched_cond_no_stomp)			- Disables your ability to stomp enemies if given the Jump Pad launched cond, if you... want that, for some reason?
4067 - "custom magazine model" (custom_magazine_model)						- Set a custom magazine model for dropped mags! Even works for weapons that don't usually eject mags - provided they have the right attachments / anim events!
4068 - "mod deflected projectiles ignite" (mod_deflected_projectiles_ignite) - Does as it says on the tin - airblasting projectiles at enemies will ignite 'em! I'm not really sure if this also applies to deflect melees, that use "deflect_on_swing"
4069 - "set reload single" (set_reload_single)								- For weapons that reload their entire clip at once, makes them reload the way Shotguns do, in increments.
4070 - "Reload time start" (mult_reload_time_start)							- For the rest of the 8 attributes below, this is to set various reload time values that are otherwise missing. You'll NEED most of these!
4071 - "Reload time start additive" (mult_reload_time_start)
4072 - "Reload time no anim speed mod" (mult_reload_time_noanimmod)
4073 - "Reload time no anim speed mod additive" (mult_reload_time_noanimmod)
4074 - "mult weapon idle time" (mult_weapon_idle_time)						- It's unclear if this does anything on most weapons. But, this has a niche use - for tf_weapon_tranq, this actually modifies the passive reload time when it's put away. Fun!
4075 - "mult weapon idle time additive" (mult_weapon_idle_time)
4076 - "Reload time refill" (mult_reload_time_refill)
4077 - "Reload time refill additive" (mult_reload_time_refill)
4078 - "mult flame velocity" (mult_flame_velocity)							- Modifies the initial speed your flame particles come out of your Flamethrower, which can increase or decrease travel distance!
4079 - "mod deflect no minicrit" (mod_deflect_no_minicrit)
4080 - "mod coil bounce damage" (mod_coil_bounce_damage_penalty)			- Modifier for the reduction in damage every time a Coilgun laser bounces! By default, this is additive, so it just flat subtracts or adds to the final reduced damage, respectively. Splice it to use percentage, and change numbers there!
4081 - "mod zoomed dont hide viewmodel" (mod_zoomed_dont_hide_viewmodel)	- Best used for stuff without a Scope, looks weird but works otherwise!
4082 - "mod spread scale scoped override" (mod_spread_scale_scoped_override)
4083 - "mult cloak capacity VISUAL ONLY" (VISUALONLY)

4084 - "silent killer no pain scream" (set_silent_killer_no_pain_scream)	- This is VERY subtle, and it isn't super obvious what it does! Normally, when you hit someone, even if it does no damage, it makes an audible default damage noise. This removes that! Useful for sneaky weapons you don't want the enemy to immediately get tipped off by!!
4085 - "mod proxymine crouchwalk ignore" (mod_proxymine_crouchwalk_ignore)	- For your active proxy mines, enemy players can crouch by them to evade setting them off. Seems to completely ignore distance at all, they can be standing practically on it until they leave or uncrouch!
4086 - "mod proxymine crouchwalk ignore owner" (mod_proxymine_crouchwalk_ignore_owner)
4087 - "mod sticky explode when shot" (mod_sticky_explode_when_shot)		- This is difficult to test, but I believe this makes it so enemy players detonate your stickybombs if they shoot / otherwise defuse them. I'm unsure what team the damage would apply to...
4088 - "mult dmg crit multiplier" (mult_dmg_crit_multiplier)				- Modifier for how much damage a critical hit does! This is a multiplier on-top of the existing one for crits (which is about 3.00), so something like 0.333 is about 1x damage.
4089 - "heal on crit beacon simple" (heal_on_crit_beacon_simple)
4090 - "beacon dont heal crit full" (beacon_dont_heal_crit_full)
4091 - "flat heal on afterburn on active harvester" (flat_heal_on_afterburn_active)
[SCUFFED] 4092 - "heal on crit beacon simple" (heal_on_crit_beacon_simple)	- This and ID 4089 share the same display name, and are otherwise identical beside their stat text. 4089 seems to load first, though.
4093 - "mod lunchbox critboostable" (mod_lunchbox_critboostable)			- Crit food!! If you consume a lunchbox item while under the influence of a critboost, it heals 3x as much (which usually overheals), and also acts as a full health kit no matter what when thrown.
4094 - "take crits from projectile airborne simple" (take_crits_projectile_airborne_simple)	- Input is how high up you need to be, in hU's, before you start taking crits from incoming projectiles.
4095 - "mod rocket gravity upward force" (mod_rocket_gravity_upward_force)	- For rockets with gravity, applies a certain amount of starting velocity either up or down when you shoot the projectile, before the gravity actually kicks in. Think of the way a mortar travels!
4096 - "mod_melee_dont_deflect_projectiles" (mod_melee_dont_deflect_projectiles)	- For "deflect_on_smack" and related, this forces it to not deflect projectiles, if you only wanted player knockback for instance.
4097 - "deflect on smack hit player" (deflect_on_smack_hit_player)
4098 - "fishwhacker sweep" (deflect_on_smack_hit_player)

[Extra Attributes by Trotim - v2.1.3]
5000 - "longer damage falloff distance" (mult_falloff_distance)				- Changes falloff distance! Higher than 1 means further away, lower means closer. Useful with some of the existing rampup / falloff attributes! Also useful for if you're only flying half a ship (looking at you, broken custom_falloff)
5001 - "shorter damage falloff distance" (mult_falloff_distance)

5002 - "less flinching when active" (mult_flinch_resist_active)				- For all 6 of these, modifies how much more or less you flinch (your screen jolting up) when taking damage. Values close to 0 mean no flinching. Can be negative for DOWNWARD flinching!! If you want that... for some reason.
5003 - "more flinching when active" (mult_flinch_resist_active)
5004 - "less flinching on wearer" (mult_flinch_resist_wearer)
5005 - "more flinching on wearer" (mult_flinch_resist_wearer)
5006 - "less flinching when aiming" (mult_flinch_resist_aiming)
5007 - "more flinching when aiming" (mult_flinch_resist_aiming)

[Extra Attributes by NitoAndTheFunkyBunch - v2.1.0]
6001 - "mod burst fire" (set_burstfire)										- On most weapons period, switches it over to a "burst-fire" mode as implied! Var sets how many shots are in 1 burst, and your old firerate stuff now controls how long between bursts! Can be used for rapid-fire bursts or even melee flurries.
6002 - "fire rate burst" (mult_burstfiredelay)								- Controls the burst-firerate of a weapon while it's using burst-fire mode - effectively acts like the original firerate modifier but moved!
6003 - "crit duration penalty" (mult_rapidfire_crit_duration)				- This is weird. I think, for timed-random-crit weapons (like Pistols and stuff), this is a modifier for the amount of time it fires critical hits?

[Easter Egg Attributes - v2.1.2. NOT PRESENT IN BASE ITEMS_GAME.TXT, must be modded back in!]
10000 - "brimstone DISPLAY ONLY 1" (brimstone_display_1)					- Display only, but TF_Weapon_BrimstoneLauncher builds up charge with damage...
10001 - "brimstone DISPLAY ONLY 2" (brimstone_display_2)					- ...and after enough damage, press your Use key to trigger faster fire-rate and no-reloading! It's a bit scuffed on non-projectile kills, though.
10002 - "mod brimstone slamfire damage required" (mod_brimstone_slamfire_damagerequired) - Additive plus-or-minus modifier for the damage required to activate TF_Weapon_BrimstoneLauncher's "slamfire" (as above). Default seems to be 500 DMG
10003 - "mult brimstone slamfire postfiredelay" (mult_brimstone_slamfire_postfiredelay) - Default fire-rate is 0.75 (25% faster). Multiplicative with your existing firerate.
10004 - "mult brimstone slamfire duration" (mult_brimstone_slamfire_duration) - The default duration is about 6s.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






//------------------------------------------------------------
//------------------------------------------------------------ I won't be explaining what most of these do since I assume you can figure it out by the names. Seriously.
//--WHAT WORKS - Attributes below generally work as intended-- If you're really curious, search items_game.txt from both TF2C and live TF2 to see what some of these mean if you need to! Context for where they're used helps.
//------------------------------------------------------------ I'll just point out unique or interesting ones, if they crop up.
//------------------------------------------------------------

1 - "damage penalty" (mult_dmg)
2 - "damage bonus" (mult_dmg)
3 - "clip size penalty" (mult_clipsize)
4 - "clip size bonus" (mult_clipsize)
5 - "fire rate penalty" (mult_postfiredelay)
6 - "fire rate bonus" (mult_postfiredelay)
7 - "heal rate penalty" (mult_medigun_healrate)
8 - "heal rate bonus" (mult_medigun_healrate)								- Only affects Mediguns, as you'd expect, but not the Shock Therapy heal.
9 - "ubercharge rate penalty" (mult_medigun_uberchargerate)					- Can be used with negatives to decrease ubercharge, if you're a sadist. No effect on "add_onhit_ubercharge".
10 - "ubercharge rate bonus" (mult_medigun_uberchargerate)
11 - "overheal bonus" (mult_medigun_overheal_amount)						- This has a lower bound of 0 (can't start overhealing at all), and an upper bound of 1 (the normal amount). Attempting to set it higher doesn't work!
15 - "crit mod disabled" (mult_crit_chance)									- This is actually a general-purpose critrate mult - if you set it to anything above 0, it actually does work!
16 - "heal on hit for rapidfire" (add_onhit_addhealth)
17 - "add uber charge on hit" (add_onhit_ubercharge)
18 - "medigun charge is crit boost" (set_charge_type)
20 - "crit vs burning players" (or_crit_vs_playercond)						- Apparently, this accepts way more than just Burning, it just happens that Burning is the first, as "1". I'm not sure how crazy you can get with this attribute!?
23 - "mod flamethrower push" (set_flamethrower_push_disabled) 				- There's an identical attribute in name that's called "disable airblast", for some reason.
25 - "hidden secondary max ammo penalty" (mult_maxammo_secondary)
26 - "max health additive bonus" (add_maxhealth)
28 - "crit mod disabled hidden" (mult_crit_chance)							- First of many. These are generally identical to their parent attributes, but the text doesn't show up.
31 - "critboost on kill" (add_onkill_critboost_time)
34 - "mult cloak meter consume rate" (mult_cloak_meter_consume_rate)
35 - "mult cloak meter regen rate" (mult_cloak_meter_regen_rate)
36 - "spread penalty" (mult_spread_scale)									- This can be added to weapons with no base spread if you splice it to be additive instead of a percentage (complicated, see Beggar's Bazooka entry for example)
37 - "hidden primary max ammo bonus" (mult_maxammo_primary)
41 - "sniper charge per sec" (mult_sniper_charge_per_sec)
43 - "scattergun no reload single" (set_scattergun_no_reload_single)		- This behaves a bit strangely. It works, but if it's on a weapon that usually reloads multiple shells, it'll reload the entire clip in the time it takes for ONE shell reload.
44 - "scattergun has knockback" (set_scattergun_has_knockback)				- One-half of the Force-a-Nature's functionality - it'll knock enemies FAR back when you hit them! Can add "apply_self_knockback" to simulate FAN jumps.
45 - "bullets per shot bonus" (mult_bullets_per_shot)						- Doesn't work on projectiles yet...
47 - "sniper no charge" (unimplemented_mod_sniper_no_charge)				- Interestingly, this works! You cannot use your alt-fire to zoom in. This DOES NOT work on other items with an alt-fire.
49 - "no double jump" (set_scout_doublejump_disabled)
54 - "move speed penalty" (mult_player_movespeed)
56 - "jarate description" (desc_jarate_description)							- This is just illustrating that these do technically "work" as intended - but this does nothing on its own beside displaying text.
57 - "health regen" (add_health_regen)
58 - "self dmg push force increased" (mult_dmgself_push_force)
59 - "self dmg push force decreased" (mult_dmgself_push_force)
60 - "dmg taken from fire reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fire)				- New as of TF2C v2.1.0! Damage Res. and Vulns of all flavors.
61 - "dmg taken from fire increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fire)
62 - "dmg taken from crit reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_crit)
63 - "dmg taken from crit increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_crit)
64 - "dmg taken from blast reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions)
65 - "dmg taken from blast increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_explosions)
66 - "dmg taken from bullets reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_bullets)
67 - "dmg taken from bullets increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_bullets)
68 - "increase player capture value" (add_player_capturevalue)				- Finally back! Works how you expect, also works with negatives (you won't be able to contribute to capture progress at all). Works correctly on multiclass - though it's not a good idea if you have this on Scout + Civ too unless you're reducing cap power!
71 - "weapon burn dmg increased" (mult_wpn_burndmg)							- This stuff refers to afterburn.
72 - "weapon burn dmg reduced" (mult_wpn_burndmg)
73 - "weapon burn time increased" (mult_wpn_burntime)						- This is on WEARER, so unless prevented, this stacks with other weapons that also have this!!
74 - "weapon burn time reduced" (mult_wpn_burntime)
75 - "aiming movespeed increased" (mult_player_aiming_movespeed)			- Modified speed while aiming. Revved Miniguns and Scoped Rifles count as "aiming". Lower bound is immobile (obviously), but upper bound can be FASTER than your default move speed!
76 - "maxammo primary increased" (mult_maxammo_primary)
77 - "maxammo primary reduced" (mult_maxammo_primary)
78 - "maxammo secondary increased" (mult_maxammo_secondary)
79 - "maxammo secondary reduced" (mult_maxammo_secondary)
80 - "maxammo metal increased" (mult_maxammo_metal)							- This modifies your metal capacity. Unused, but it works fine.
81 - "maxammo metal reduced" (mult_maxammo_metal)
82 - "cloak consume rate increased" (mult_cloak_meter_consume_rate)
83 - "cloak consume rate decreased" (mult_cloak_meter_consume_rate)
84 - "cloak regen rate increased" (mult_cloak_meter_regen_rate)
85 - "cloak regen rate decreased" (mult_cloak_meter_regen_rate)
86 - "minigun spinup time increased" (mult_minigun_spinup_time)
87 - "minigun spinup time decreased" (mult_minigun_spinup_time)
88 - "max pipebombs increased" (add_max_pipebombs)
89 - "max pipebombs decreased" (add_max_pipebombs)
90 - "SRifle Charge rate increased" (mult_sniper_charge_per_sec)
91 - "SRifle Charge rate decreased" (mult_sniper_charge_per_sec)
92 - "Construction rate increased" (mult_construction_value)
93 - "Construction rate decreased" (mult_construction_value)
94 - "Repair rate increased" (mult_repair_value)
95 - "Repair rate decreased" (mult_repair_value)
96 - "Reload time increased" (mult_reload_time)
97 - "Reload time decreased" (mult_reload_time)
98 - "selfdmg on hit for rapidfire" (add_onhit_addhealth)
99 - "Blast radius increased" (mult_explosion_radius)
100 - "Blast radius decreased" (mult_explosion_radius)
101 - "Projectile range increased" (mult_projectile_range)					- A modifier for hitscan range! Input is a multiplier for the default hitscan range, which is usually 4096 hU's.
102 - "Projectile range decreased" (mult_projectile_range)
103 - "Projectile speed increased" (mult_projectile_speed)
104 - "Projectile speed decreased" (mult_projectile_speed)
105 - "overheal penalty" (mult_medigun_overheal_amount)
106 - "weapon spread bonus" (mult_spread_scale)
107 - "move speed bonus" (mult_player_movespeed)
108 - "health from packs increased" (mult_health_frompacks)
109 - "health from packs decreased" (mult_health_frompacks)
110 - "heal on hit for slowfire" (add_onhit_addhealth)
111 - "selfdmg on hit for slowfire" (add_onhit_addhealth)
114 - "mod mini-crit airborne" (mini_crit_airborne)							- Only activates for blast knockbacks / jump pads! mini_crit_airborne_simple activates from any kind of airborne (even jumps)
123 - "speed boost when active" (mult_move_speed_when_active)
125 - "max health additive penalty" (add_maxhealth)
127 - "sticky air burst mode" (set_detonate_mode)							- Some unique toggles for Detonation on certain Demoman projectiles. So far, only works on Pill Grenades. 2 is LnL's shattering bombs, 3 is bombs that explode on the world.
128 - "provide on active" (provide_on_active)								- Bread-and-butter meta-attribute for restricting stats to only apply while the weapon is out! Obviously is an all-or-nothing deal, even helpful wearer-effects get restricted, so be aware!
129 - "health drain" (add_health_regen)
135 - "rocket jump damage reduction" (rocket_jump_dmg_reduction)			- Contrary to the name, this applies to any kind of blast jump!
137 - "dmg bonus vs buildings" (mult_dmg_vs_buildings)
144 - "lunchbox adds minicrits" (set_weapon_mode)							- Seems to be used as a global "weapon mode" attribute. It has nothing to do with a Heavy Sandvich anymore. It works on certain weapons. (Temp List: Medigun[1], Invis[3]).
148 - "building cost reduction" (building_cost_reduction)					- Technically uncapped, but the costs can go over your current max metal capacity.
149 - "bleeding duration" (bleeding_duration)
158 - "add cloak on kill" (add_cloak_on_kill)
159 - "SET BONUS: cloak blink time penalty" (cloak_blink_time_penalty)
160 - "SET BONUS: quiet unstealth" (set_quiet_unstealth)					- This almost totally mutes your uncloak. A bit OP, at least I think so.
161 - "flame size penalty" (mult_flame_size)								- These two "technically" do something, but they're very buggy, so I don't recommend doing anything with them. Just here for completion since they have "an effect".
162 - "flame size bonus" (mult_flame_size)
166 - "add cloak on hit" (add_cloak_on_hit)
169 - "SET BONUS: dmg from sentry reduced" (dmg_from_sentry_reduced)
170 - "airblast cost increased" (mult_airblast_cost)
171 - "airblast cost decreased" (mult_airblast_cost)
173 - "flame ammopersec increased" (mult_flame_ammopersec)					- Modifies ammo consumption rate of a Flamethrower. Doesn't change how much damage you do, though. It's like a fuel leak.
174 - "flame ammopersec decreased" (mult_flame_ammopersec)
177 - "deploy time increased" (mult_deploy_time)							- Modifies weapon switch speed between ALL of your weapons
178 - "deploy time decreased" (mult_deploy_time)
179 - "minicrits become crits" (minicrits_become_crits)
180 - "heal on kill" (heal_on_kill)											- NOTE, this applies if you get a kill while the weapon is out, but it doesn't need to be from that weapon's own damage. PLAN AROUND THIS!!
181 - "no self blast dmg" (no_self_blast_dmg)								- Rocket & Sticky Jumper.
183 - "aiming movespeed decreased" (mult_player_aiming_movespeed)
199 - "switch from wep deploy time decreased" (mult_switch_from_wep_deploy_time)
202 - "charge time increased" (mod_charge_time)								- No text, but modifies Ubercharge time.
203 - "drop health pack on kill" (drop_health_pack_on_kill)					- It's back!! Works similarly to Medieval mode's dropped healthkits, except using the regular old small healthkit model.
207 - "blast dmg to self increased" (blast_dmg_to_self)
208 - "Set DamageType Ignite" (set_dmgtype_ignite)
215 - "apply z velocity on damage" (apply_z_velocity_on_damage)				- When you hit an enemy, apply a variable velocity in Hu/S to them in the Up-Down direction! Positive values send upward, negative values send downward.
216 - "apply look velocity on damage" (apply_look_velocity_on_damage)		- As above, when you hit an enemy, apply velocity in the direction you're facing, backwards or forwards. ALSO NOTE: Neither of these two attribs have falloff! Use wisely!
221 - "mult decloak rate" (mult_decloak_rate)								- No text, but modifies how long it takes for you to become visible after decloaking.
238 - "minigun no spin sounds" (minigun_no_spin_sounds)						- Gets rid of both the spin and unrev sound, if the Minigun had those. You can also just set those sounds to... silence. Manually. Either-or.
241 - "reload time increased hidden" (mult_reload_time_hidden)
253 - "mult cloak rate" (mult_cloak_rate)
256 - "mult airblast refire time" (mult_airblast_refire_time)				- Resembles that glitch you can do on the Commentary Maps at low values. Also drains your ammo at lightning speed unless you lower the consumption.
259 - "boots falling stomp" (boots_falling_stomp)							- The Mantreads are, surprisingly, coded in almost perfectly. Guess they scrapped it!
260 - "deflection size multiplier" (deflection_size_multiplier)				- No text, but this increases or decreases your Airblast's effective range.
263 - "melee bounds multiplier" (melee_bounds_multiplier)					- These two are used to increase your melee range. They always appear together, so hard to say what they do individually.
264 - "melee range multiplier" (melee_range_multiplier)
266 - "projectile penetration" (projectile_penetration)						- FOR ARROWS ONLY!! If your projectile is an arrow, this attrib will let it pierce through players. If you don't want it to also headshot, better disable or modify that as well!!
267 - "mod crit while airborne" (crit_while_airborne)						- If you're blast jumping or jumppad-launched, you'll do crits while in the air! For Blast Jumps I feel like it only works on Soldier + Demoman...
278 - "effect bar recharge rate increased" (effectbar_recharge_rate)		- No text, but this DOES work. The only item I'm aware of that is affected is the MIRV currently, though.
279 - "maxammo grenades1 increased" (mult_maxammo_grenades1)				- Certain unconventional weapons use "Grenades1" as an ammo type - such as the MIRV and the Shock Therapy.
280 - "override projectile type" (override_projectile_type)					- Change your projectiles to something else! Works for most conventional projectiles, as well as to-and-from bullets. I listed ones I know of in the BitFlag specifics section!
281 - "energy weapon no ammo" (energy_weapon_no_ammo)						- This works as-is, but you can also replicate this by increasing ammo efficiency (no ammo spent while shooting) or making your reserve ammo nearly impossible to drain conventionally (999).
286 - "engy building health bonus" (mult_engy_building_health)
287 - "engy sentry damage bonus" (mult_engy_sentry_damage)
289 - "centerfire projectile" (centerfire_projectile)						- Works for everything I've tested it with, not just rockets - forces the projectile to ALWAYS fire from the center! Maybe a little moot, now that "tf2c_centerfire_preference" exists...
298 - "mod ammo per shot" (mod_ammo_per_shot)								- Changes your "ammo efficiency" - how much each shot decrements your ammo counter. -1 in conjunction with "mod max primary clip override" allows for a functionally infinite clip (with no reloading to boot).
303 - "mod max primary clip override" (mod_max_primary_clip_override)		- Changes how much ammo is loaded in your clip by force. You can set this to -1 to have your weapon operate solely on its reserves (it DOESN'T reload!).
314 - "uber duration bonus" (add_uber_time)									- No text.
318 - "faster reload rate" (fast_reload)
326 - "increased jump height" (mod_jump_height)
328 - "disable fancy class select anim" (disable_fancy_class_select_anim)
231 - "medigun charge is megaheal" (set_charge_type)						- This attribute class is "set_charge_type", and in TF2C, "2" isn't megaheal, but instead a combo of minicrits + damage resistance + heals on both yourself and the patient (see "medigun charge is push buff").
234 - "mod medic healed deploy time penalty" (mod_medic_healed_deploy_time)	- A very strange attribute. When you aren't being healed by a Medic, your weapon deploy speed is affected.
301 - "mod use metal ammo type" (mod_use_metal_ammo_type)					- Extremely jank. It DOES switch your ammo type, but it's invisible on non-engi and changes your max metal capacity (unmodified) in odd ways per class.
343 - "engy sentry fire rate increased" (mult_sentry_firerate)
344 - "engy sentry radius increased" (mult_sentry_range)
345 - "engy dispenser radius increased" (mult_dispenser_radius)
348 - "fire rate penalty hidden" (mult_postfiredelay)
350 - "ragdolls become ash" (ragdolls_become_ash)
362 - "crit from behind" (crit_from_behind)									- Heyyyy! Nobody told me this worked!! Anyway, does as it says - it deals crits if you're behind an enemy when they take damage from your weapon. For projectiles, that's relative to you. Also, "behind" is extremely generous... because it triggers if you're essentially anywhere in the 180 degrees behind them.
390 - "headshot damage increase" (headshot_damage_modify)
252 - "damage force reduction" (damage_force_reduction)
353 - "cannot pick up buildings" (cannot_pick_up_buildings)
356 - "airblast disabled" (airblast_disabled)
378 - "sniper aiming movespeed decreased" (mult_player_aiming_movespeed)
394 - "fire rate bonus hidden" (mult_postfiredelay)
396 - "melee attack rate bonus" (mult_postfiredelay)						- Just a text difference for the same firing speed attribute.
400 - "cannot pick up intelligence" (cannot_pick_up_intelligence)
407 - "crit vs disguised players" (or_crit_vs_playercond)
408 - "crit vs non burning players" (or_crit_vs_not_playercond)
412 - "dmg taken increased" (mult_dmgtaken)									- DMG VULNERABILITY THAT WORKS!
414 - "self mark for death" (self_mark_for_death)							- Mark yourself for death! Triggers if set to at least 1.0 - values higher will set the time you remain marked after switching to that in seconds. Seems to be conditional. Melee only?
421 - "no primary ammo from dispensers while active" (no_primary_ammo_from_dispensers)
424 - "clip size penalty hidden" (mult_clipsize)
425 - "sapper damage bonus" (mult_sapper_damage)
426 - "sapper damage penalty" (mult_sapper_damage)
427 - "sapper damage leaches health" (sapper_damage_leaches_health)			- Intended to leech health off of sapped buildings onto yourself. Please do not use rn, it applies permanent megaheal to yourself EVEN AFTER DYING OR SWITCHING CLASSES. VERY BAD.	
428 - "sapper health bonus" (mult_sapper_health)
429 - "sapper health penalty" (mult_sapper_health)
434 - "sapper damage penalty hidden" (mult_sapper_damage)
437 - "crit vs stunned players" (or_crit_vs_playercond)
438 - "crit vs wet players" (crit_vs_wet_players)
442 - "major move speed bonus" (mult_player_movespeed)
443 - "major increased jump height" (mod_jump_height)
464 - "engineer sentry build rate multiplier" (sentry_build_rate_multiplier)
465 - "engineer teleporter build rate multiplier" (teleporter_build_rate_multiplier)
469 - "engineer building teleporting pickup" (building_teleporting_pickup)	- Rescue Ranger's long-range pickup is the only surviving attribute from it. It works perfectly well, however! The var controls exactly how much metal gets deducted when you do a long-range pickup.
475 - "Projectile speed increased hidden" (mult_projectile_speed)
476 - "damage bonus hidden" (mult_dmg)
479 - "overheal fill rate reduced" (overheal_fill_rate)						- Modifies how long it takes for Overheal to fill to max, when applicable!
489 - "SET BONUS: move speed set bonus" (mult_player_movespeed)
490 - "SET BONUS: health regen set bonus" (add_health_regen)
491 - "SET BONUS: dmg taken from crit reduced set bonus" (mult_dmgtaken_from_crit)
492 - "SET BONUS: dmg taken from fire reduced set bonus" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fire)
516 - "SET BONUS: dmg taken from bullets increased" (mult_dmgtaken_from_bullets)
517 - "SET BONUS: max health additive bonus" (add_maxhealth)
518 - "scattergun knockback mult" (scattergun_knockback_mult)				- As the name implies, this is a modifier for Force-a-Nature shot knockback. ONLY works for that! It works as you'd expect though.
524 - "increased jump height from weapon" (mod_jump_height_from_weapon)
525 - "damage force increase" (damage_force_reduction)
526 - "healing received bonus" (mult_healing_received)
535 - "damage force increase hidden" (damage_force_reduction)
536 - "damage force increase text" (damage_force_reduction)
526 - "healing received bonus" (mult_healing_received)
547 - "single wep deploy time decreased" (mult_single_wep_deploy_time)
550 - "halloween increased jump height" (mod_jump_height)
551 - "special taunt" (special_taunt)										- If a weapon has a taunt that SHOULD NOT be canceled by say, Thriller or April Fool's Laugh, put this on it. Applicable for stuff that taunt-kills and consumables. Also, pressing M2 makes you taunt if you have a Bonesaw!
614 - "no metal from dispensers while active" (no_metal_from_dispensers_while_active)
643 - "rocket jump damage reduction hidden" (rocket_jump_dmg_reduction)
644 - "clipsize increase on kill" (clipsize_increase_on_kill)				- Works now! FYI - You HAVE to put a limiter on it using "clipsize_increase_on_kill_cap", or else it'll just go up forever. You can also set how much more clip it gives you after a kill.
651 - "fire rate bonus with reduced health" (mult_postfiredelay_with_reduced_health) - A pretty strange one, but it does what it says on the tin. Firerate slowly increments / decrements to the listed value (from 1, your default) as you lose health
670 - "stickybomb charge rate" (stickybomb_charge_rate)						- How long it takes to fully charge a Stickybomb launch. Game multiplies your inputted var by about 4 for the amount of seconds it takes.
671 - "grenade no bounce" (grenade_no_bounce)								- Works now! It's hard to figure out at first, but your grenades really do have VERY little bounciness - on hitting a wall or surface, they barely move at all.
674 - "class select override vcd" (class_select_override_vcd) 				- Force the class to play a different ".vcd" animation on the Class Select screen. Useful.
675 - "custom projectile model" (custom_projectile_model)					- Set a custom model for the projectile - if it supports it. Rockets, Pipes, Stickies, and Tranq Darts fit this bill, currently!
681 - "grenade no spin" (grenade_no_spin)									- Grenades fly true in the air and don't tumble at all.
684 - "grenade detonation damage penalty" (grenade_detonation_damage_penalty)
732 - "metal_pickup_decreased" (mult_metal_pickup)
734 - "healing received penalty" (mult_healing_received)
739 - "ubercharge overheal rate penalty" (mult_medigun_overheal_uberchargerate) - If the patient is overhealed, modify the ubercharge gain rate! Presumably nuking it into the ground.
740 - "reduced_healing_from_medics" (mult_healing_from_medics)
772 - "single wep holster time increased" (mult_switch_from_wep_deploy_time) - SUPPOSED to change the speed drawing the next weapon you switch to - but it's buggy and applies to the next-NEXT weapon (If it was on Fireaxe and you switch to Shotgun, it'll only apply when you switch off Shotgun, even back to Fireaxe)
773 - "single wep deploy time increased" (mult_single_wep_deploy_time)		- Modifies the speed when switching to / drawing a weapon!
774 - "charge time decreased" (mod_charge_time)
775 - "dmg penalty vs buildings" (mult_dmg_vs_buildings)
781 - "is_a_sword" (is_a_sword)												- Well, is it? In seriousness, this extends your melee range by some variable amount of hammer units, I think...
787 - "fuse bonus" (fuse_mult)												- Works now! ALSO, the visual indicator particle slows down or speeds up to match the fuse time - great feature! Also works with the MIRV.
790 - "mod teleporter cost" (mod_teleporter_cost)							- No text.
794 - "dmg taken from fire reduced on active" (mult_dmgtaken_from_fire_active)
795 - "damage bonus vs burning" (mult_dmg_vs_burning)
796 - "min_viewmodel_offset" (min_viewmodel_offset)							- Used for "tf_use_min_viewmodels 1" to shift the VM's position (usually a bit down and a tiny bit forward).
797 - "dmg pierces resists absorbs" (mod_pierce_resists_absorbs)			- Civilian's defensive aura counts as a "resist" for the purposes of this attribute. It might apply to "stat" resists too but I'm not terribly sure yet.
800 - "patient overheal penalty" (mult_patient_overheal_penalty)
822 - "airblast_destroy_projectile" (airblast_destroy_projectile)			- Surprisingly works now, when you do airblast a projectile, it'll fizzle out harmlessly with a flame sound and electrical particles. Maybe related to the pre-release Coilgun? Also doesn't work on airblast-adjacent stuff
851 - "mult_player_movespeed_active" (mult_player_movespeed_active)
852 - "mult_dmgtaken_active" (mult_dmgtaken_active)
853 - "mult_patient_overheal_penalty_active" (mult_patient_overheal_penalty_active)
868 - "crit_dmg_falloff" (crit_dmg_falloff)									- This is a binary toggle - if it's enabled, then Crits suffer falloff like everything else!
869 - "crits become minicrits" (crits_become_minicrits)						- All crits, even random ones, become minicrits with this attrib. Surprisingly, affects backstabs! (though those are still 1HKOs no matter what - doing [Current HP x 2 x 1.35])
876 - "lunchbox healing decreased" (lunchbox_healing_scale)					- Finally works! Does as you'd expect, changes how much you get healed per tick. Does NOT work with negatives, so no hurting yourself via eating!
1000 - "CARD: damage bonus" (mult_dmg)
1001 - "CARD: dmg taken from bullets reduced" (mult_dmgtaken_from_bullets)
1002 - "CARD: move speed bonus" (mult_player_movespeed)
1003 - "CARD: health regen" (add_health_regen)
2029 - "allowed in medieval mode" (allowed_in_medieval_mode)
2043 - "upgrade rate decrease" (upgrade_rate_mod)							- Modifies amount of metal you put into a building when hitting it with your Wrench.
2058 - "meter_label" (meter_label)											- Seems to be used for a few select weapons with meters - like the Sandvich or MIRV. Seems to be fixed with TF2C v2.1.0. However, the actual meters showing up is still kinda hardcoded...
2062 - "airblast cost scale hidden" (mult_airblast_cost)

???? - "???" (mult_rocketjump_deploy_time)									- Unmarked w/ no entry. Affects your weapon switch speed while you're in the middle of a Rocket Jump. Use 'value_is_percentage'-type attribs for splicing.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






//---------------------------------------------------- This is just gonna be a small section covering some working AddCond conditions, for reference!
//---------------------------------------------------- These are essentially conditions the game uses to keep track of various status effects.
//--Working AddCond Conditions ----------------------- Most of this is copied over from Foxysen's v2.0.2 Attributes Listing - and they know a lot more than I! If you want more detailed comments on those attribs, check those out.
//----------------------------------------------------
//---------------------------------------------------- There ARE more conds than are listed here, but as I said, this just covers ones that work / visibly do something when added! Many others not listed do "work", but only in the backend.

0 - "Aiming / Revved" (TF_COND_AIMING) - "Aiming", for Minigun Rev and SR Scope. It'll change your animation state to "ACT_MP_DEPLOYED" and has no effect on speed by itself, most of the time.
1 - "Scoped-In" (TF_COND_ZOOMED) - Sniper Rifle scoped-in state? Something like that, it adds the Scope overlay for as long as it's active and you don't switch weps, and sometimes the damage charge bar moves when you attack? No other effect on non-Sniper Rifle though.
2 - "Disguising" (TF_COND_DISGUISING) - In the process of Disguising? Seems to work on all classes. It goes by your last stored disguise - if you don't have one, it's buggy. It works fine on Spy, but FYI, it doesn't work if added via attribute.
4 - "Cloaked" (TF_COND_STEALTHED) - Spy Cloak! Makes you invisible, can't attack, if you're on Spy then do all the usual cloak stuff like the watch and the drain. When the cond ends, the cloak disappears instantly on non-Spy!
5 - "Medigun: Ubercharge" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE) - Medigun Ubercharge, not much to say. IMPORTANT NOTE; Medigun Uber conds will WEAR OFF when you run into any source of healing! If you want to use invincibility, use another condition!
6 - "Just Teleported" (TF_COND_TELEPORTED) - Freshly teleported! I think all it does is apply the little teleporter dust particles to you. Cute.
8 - "Uber: Wearing Off" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE_WEARINGOFF) - Uber Wearing-off effect. If you have an active Invuln Uber, adding this will make you flash as if you're about to lose it. It'll stay until either this or the uber ends though.
10 - "Teleporting" (TF_COND_SELECTED_TO_TELEPORT) - Teleporting helper! Not obvious at first, but among other things you can't pick up Intel / Flags, I think.
11 - "Medigun: Kritz" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED) - Medigun Kritz charge, does what it says on the tin. IMPORTANT NOTE; Medigun Uber conds will WEAR OFF when you run into any source of healing! If you want to use full crits, use another condition!
14 - "Bonk Invuln" (TF_COND_PHASE) - Bonk! Atomic Punch invulnerability! So far as I can tell it doesn't do much of anything at all, let alone give invuln, but it'll block any stuns, and keep you in thirdperson after you do a taunt?
15 - "Stunned" (TF_COND_STUN) - Stunned helper! VERY broken, adds the slowed icon AND BREAKS A BUNCH OF MOVEMENT / CLASS / WEAPON STUFF!! It probably needs some external info to tell it WHAT stun to apply (ie: Stun type - movement or no? And how long is it?)
17 - "Charging" (TF_COND_SHIELD_CHARGE) Shield Charge! Rush forward at about 720 hU/s, with no turn limiter or Demoman scream. Colliding with something does the shield bash like normal.
22 - "Burning" (TF_COND_BURNING) - On fire helper. Doesn't actually apply any afterburn and just makes the class scream briefly about it. Gets removed by what you'd expect. Probably needs some extra info to work (ie: Burn damage? Burn time? Who dealt it?)
24 - "Jarate'd" (TF_COND_URINE) - Jarate effects! Does very little on its own, makes your models a bit yellow. Gets removed faster if healed.
28 - "Medigun: Megaheal" (TF_COND_MEGAHEAL) - Medigun Megaheal charge, doesn't really work that much. BUT, it will block stuns and prevent any non-self-knockback! So, still useful!
30 - "Marked for Death" (TF_COND_MARKEDFORDEATH) - Marked for Death. Does what it says on the tin, it marks for death... people marked take minicrits. Also plays the sound and shows an icon!
32 - "Speed Boosted" (TF_COND_SPEED_BOOST) Speed Boost! You run faster while active, that's it. Also shows a little icon on the HUD. Useful though.
33 - "Crits: Pumpkin" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_PUMPKIN) - A generic critboost! This, as well as the next 6 critboosts, are just unconditional crits with the effects and all. Useful.
34 - "Crits: Canteen" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_USER_BUFF)
35 - "Crits: Charging" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_DEMO_CHARGE)
37 - "Crits: First Blood" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_FIRST_BLOOD)
38 - "Crits: Round Win" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_BONUS_TIME)
39 - "Crits: Flag Cap" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_CTF_CAPTURE)
40 - "Crits: Kill" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_ON_KILL)
41 - "Melee Only" (TF_COND_CANNOT_SWITCH_FROM_MELEE) - Forced to Melee! Does as it says, you're forced to melee for however long this cond lasts. Switches back after it runs out.
48 - "Silent MfD" (TF_COND_MARKEDFORDEATH_SILENT) - Marked for Death (again). Dev notes say something about it being the same as normal, just that you don't get assist credit for kills with it. Weird, but ok.
49 - "Dispenserized" (TF_COND_DISGUISED_AS_DISPENSER) - Dispenser disguise? Contrary to notes, you don't appear as a Dispenser when crouched to enemies. Your move speed is maxed out which is a little yikes (520 hU/s) Sus. Also, the speed doesn't go away until you switch weapons with the condition removed.
51 - "Uber: Hidden" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE_HIDE_UNLESS_DAMAGED) - Uber Invuln, but also hidden! Visually, you don't look ubered unless you take damage, in which case you still don't take damage and look shiny invuln for 2s.
52 - "Uber: Canteen" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE_USER_BUFF) - A generic Uber Invuln! Nothing much to say.
53 - "Bomb Head!" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_BOMB_HEAD) - Bomb-Head from SF12! There's no bomb obviously, but the most interesting effect is the forced thirdperson for the duration. Also, no slowdown from movement stuns!
54 - "Thriller" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_THRILLER) - Thriller Dance-Off from SF12. Doesn't force the Thriller taunt. When you do any taunt, you stay in thirdperson after you're done, until the condition ends.
56 - "Crits: Spell" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_CARD_EFFECT)
57 - "Uber: Spell" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE_CARD_EFFECT)
64 - "Stealthed" (TF_COND_STEALTHED_USER_BUFF) - Stealthed; like normal Cloak, but can still attack! Not really affected by most conventional cloak stuff either. Takes a REALLY long time to decloak on removal / expiry...
67 - "Bullet Immunity" (TF_COND_BULLET_IMMUNE) - Immunity to Bullets, and other stuff that uses the damage type [DMG_BULLET, DMG_BUCKSHOT].
68 - "Blast Immunity" (TF_COND_BLAST_IMMUNE) - Immunity to Explosives, and other stuff that uses the damage type [DMG_BLAST].
69 - "Fire Immunity" (TF_COND_FIRE_IMMUNE) - Immunity to Fire, and other stuff that uses the damage type [DMG_BURN, DMG_IGNITE].
74 - "Gigantified" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_GIANT) - Giant Spell from SF13! Makes players 3x as big, forces thirdperson, and sets their max health to 10x! Note: can easily get stuck if used somewhere enclosed, but you should get unstuck after it expires.
75 - "Minified" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_TINY) - Mini Spell from SF13! Makes players 3x as small and forces thirdperson. Note: can easily get stuck if cond expires somewhere enclosed. Only escape is DEATH (or getting minified again and not getting stuck this time)
77 - "Ghostified" (TF_COND_HALLOWEEN_GHOST_MODE) - Ghost-in-Hell effect from SF13. Doesn't actually turn you into a ghost, just forces Thirdperson with no other weird gimmick. Useful!
105 - "Crits: Powerup" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_RUNE_TEMP)

(Note that TF2C's conds occupy the space of some Live TF2 conditions, as of TF2C v2.1.0. Stuff might break for the rare map that does use those)
109 - "Tranquilized" (TF_COND_TRANQUILIZED) - Tranq'd! You know how it works. Slower speed + weapon functions, dulled hearing, colorblinded + team blinded. Knives will crit players with this condition!
110 - "Airblasted" (TF_COND_AIRBLASTED) - Airblast helper. Prevents players from moving / strafing toward the origin. Flamethrower gives origin info on airblast, but otherwise, "origin" is literally the map origin... yikes. Try not to use.
111 - "VIP: Defensive Buff" (TF_COND_RESISTANCE_BUFF) - VIP Def. Buff! Players with the buff take 35% less damage from all sources. Also they get neat visual / audio effects. Technically numbers are changable by cvar, but who changes those???
112 - "VIP: Damage Buff" (TF_COND_DAMAGE_BOOST) - VIP Minicrits! Also applies to your owned Sentries and Medigun healing. Applies the usual minicrit visuals too.
113 - "Launched / Falling" (TF_COND_LAUNCHED) - Jump Pad / Mantreads falling! If you land on someone, transfer fall damage, etc etc. Usually removed if touching the ground, so might be tricky to use...
114 - "Crits: Hidden" (TF_COND_CRITBOOSTED_HIDDEN) - Crits, but also hidden! You still 100% crit, but your gun doesn't visibly look or sound critboosted. Fire sounds are still crits obviously...
115 - "Super Marked for Death" (TF_COND_SUPERMARKEDFORDEATH) - Marked for Hyper Death! It's the same as regular MfD, but you also take full crits from melee too. Gray icon.
116 - "Super MfD Silent" (TF_COND_SUPERMARKEDFORDEATH_SILENT) - Marked for Hyper Death. More or less same as before. Red icon.
118 - "Extreme Speed Boost" (TF_COND_SPEEDBOOST_DETONATOR) - Some kind of Speed Boost? It's notably faster than TF_COND_SPEED_BOOST, and has no icon on the HUD
119 - "Invincibility" (TF_COND_INVULNERABLE_SMOKE_BOMB) - INVINCIBILITY!! You just don't take damage from anything at all. No other effects, visual or otherwise. Similar to the God command in other Source games...
120 - "Defensive Buff Hidden" (TF_COND_CIV_DEFENSEBUFF) - Resistance buff? No icon on the HUD, otherwise seems to be the same as TF_COND_RESISTANCE_BUFF. Wears off when being healed, like other Medigun conds.
121 - "Haste Buff" (TF_COND_CIV_SPEEDBUFF) - Haste powerup! Or, something similar to it. Functions similar to Speed Boost, but also makes weapon functions faster! Also plays the Disciplinary Action sounds and spawns speed trail particles.
122 - "Marked Outline" (TF_COND_MARKED_OUTLINE) - Outlined! When applied to an enemy, makes them have a team-colored outline that shows through walls to everyone else.
123 - "Uber: Minicrits" (TF_COND_RADIAL_UBER) - Some kind of Medigun Minicrits? It wears off if you get healed, like other Uber conds. If added via Uber, also seems to add Cond 120 (the weird def buff) too
125 - "Medigun: Bonus Healing" (TF_COND_TAKEBONUSHEALING) - If on a teammate, friendly healing actions towards them will heal 50% more. A little strange...
126 - "Sentry Aggression" (TF_COND_DID_DISGUISE_BREAKING_ACTION) - Directly related to the "sentries_no_aggro" attrib, not too useful otherwise. If you're an enemy, then the Sentry attacks you even without you doing anything for a variable amount of time. Doesn't actually do anything if you're disguised. Again, useless...
128 - "Slowed" (TF_COND_???) - Slowed! It makes you move slower, also has an icon on the HUD. Your movement speed is all it seemingly affects, you can still jump and weapon functions remain the same.
129 - "Super Marked for Death" (TF_COND_???) - MfD of some sort. Not much to say, these go undocumented so just use the old ones IMO!
130 - "Silent MfD" (TF_COND_???) - MfD of some sort. Not much to say, these go undocumented so just use the old ones IMO!





//---------------------------------------------------- This is some reference for some of the more obscure "BitFlag" type attributes (as well as some other ones with internal lists or stuff)
//---------------------------------------------------- BitFlags are essentially a way for the game to mix and match combinations of effects using just one input number
//--BitFlag / Unique Attrib Specifics ----------------
//---------------------------------------------------- As a bad example, if you want a bowl of icecream, and we have a set of values like [1 - Vanilla, 2 - Chocolate, 4 - Strawberry, 8 - Mint, 16 - sprinkles],
//---------------------------------------------------- then a value of "25" as an input tells the game you want Vanilla and Mint icecream with Sprinkles (1 + 8 + 16)

20 - "crit vs burning players" (or_crit_vs_playercond)
Uses bitflags to figure out what conds to check for crits against, can be added up for multiple crits vs. effects on one weapon (Yikes????)

Uses an internal list to set what projectile something turns into!
(Also will list what they respond to, for Modders)

1 - Bullet
2 - Rocket (Rocket-based w/ no grav, can model change. Explodes on impact)
3 - Pipe Bomb (Pipe-based w/ physics, can model change. Explodes on impact and after time. Has a working timer particle)
4 - Stickybomb (Physics, can model change. If not on SBL, these are buggy, and won't disappear unless you switch class)
5 - Syringe
6 - Flare (Rocket-based w/ grav, can model change. Hits players, fizzles on world. Ignites + crits burning by default)
8 - Arrow
14 - Stickybomb again (Allegedly this is for Sticky Jumper...??)

29 - Nail
30 - Tranq Dart (Rocket-based w/ grav, can model change. Hits players, sticks to world)
31 - Dynamite Pack (Pipe-based w/ physics, can model change. Hits players, explodes after time. Bomblets can't really be modified except for count)

//-----//

3314 - "mod melee crit swing custom damage" (mod_melee_crit_swing_custom_damage)
Uses an internal list to determine what effect happens on a Crit Melee Kill! Below is what I can figure out;
(Additionally, for these kills, the game seems to act as if you had actually gotten a special kill / event kill internally, for whatever it was, so be wary!!)

As a short list of ones with animations / interesting effects;

1 - Headshot (Anim, Kill Icon, Particles)
2 - Backstab (Anim, Kill Icon)
3 - Burning (Anim. No other special effects)
14 - Telefrag (Kill Icon. No other special effects)
27 - Decapitation! (Anim, Particles)
29 - Gibbed! (Anim, Particles)
30 - Boioing! (Sends ragdoll flying! Crits do default damage, killfeed says you Finished Off enemy)

//-----//

4032 - "mod use custom ammo type" (mod_use_custom_ammo_type)
Uses an internal list to determine what ammo type to switch a particular weapon over to! Ostensibly, this has some other side effects, so be wary.

1 - Primary Ammo
2 - Secondary Ammo
3 - Metal (Most classes have 100 Metal. Also, this is buggy, can cause issues with metal amount and HUD display)

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Most of these have no level of functionality, or are completely missing anything to use them on (like hats or certain weapon types).
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Many, however, do appear on your weapon as a string describing what it does, but any functionality associated is largely absent.
//--WHAT DOESN'T WORK - Attributes below generally are either missing or don't have any code-- Shared type attributes, like "set_weapon_mode", are here if not in TF2C. Workarounds are listed if applicable, so check around!
//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ALL of the attribs in this section will be labelled [NON-FUNC] by default, so let me know if something here works that shouldn't be here! 

[NON-FUNC] 12 - "overheal decay penalty" (mult_medigun_overheal_decay)
[NON-FUNC] 13 - "overheal decay bonus" (mult_medigun_overheal_decay)
[NON-FUNC] 14 - "overheal decay disabled" (mult_medigun_overheal_decay)
[NON-FUNC] 19 - "tmp dmgbuff on hit" (addperc_ondmgdone_tmpbuff)
[NON-FUNC] 21 - "dmg penalty vs nonburning" (mult_dmg_vs_nonburning)
[NON-FUNC] 22 - "no crit vs nonburning" (set_nocrit_vs_nonburning)
[NON-FUNC] 24 - "mod flamethrower back crit" (set_flamethrower_back_crit)
[NON-FUNC] 27 - "alt-fire disabled" (unimplemented_altfire_disabled)
[NON-FUNC] 30 - "fists have radial buff" (set_weapon_mode)					- The Attribute Class is just set_weapon_mode - and that's used and works, albeit for the "lunchbox adds minicrits" attribute, generally.
[NON-FUNC] 32 - "slow enemy on hit" (mult_onhit_enemyspeed)
[NON-FUNC] 33 - "set cloak is feign death" (set_weapon_mode)
[NON-FUNC] 38 - "mod bat launches balls" (set_weapon_mode)
[NON-FUNC] 39 - "dmg penalty vs nonstunned" (unimplemented_mod_dmg_vs_nonstunned)	- This can't be tested in TF2C - no stunning effects exist yet. However, based on the attr class-name, it most likely has no effect.
[NON-FUNC] 40 - "zoom speed mod disabled" (unimplemented_mod_zoom_speed_disabled)	- Speed boost while scoped. Can be sorta-replicated by changing "aiming move speed" to a higher value. Revved Miniguns and Scoped Rifles count as "aiming". Max speed is normal walking speed this way, though!
[NON-FUNC] 42 - "sniper no headshots" (set_weapon_mode)						- Can use the attribute "no_headshot"
[NON-FUNC] 46 - "sniper zoom penalty" (mult_zoom_fov)						- Could try using the TF2C attribute "mod_sniper_zoom_fov_override" to adjust your FOV.
[NON-FUNC] 48 - "set cloak is movement based" (set_weapon_mode)
[NON-FUNC] 50 - "absorb damage while cloaked" (unimplemented_absorb_dmg_while_cloaked)
[NON-FUNC] 51 - "revolver use hit locations" (set_weapon_mode)
[NON-FUNC] 52 - "backstab shield" (set_blockbackstab_once)
[NON-FUNC] 53 - "fire retardant" (set_fire_retardant)						- TO AN EXTENT you can do this by setting "mult_dmgtaken_from_fire" to 0?
[NON-FUNC] 55 - "obsolete ammo penalty"
[NON-FUNC] 69 - "health from healers reduced" (mult_health_fromhealers)		- To some extent, you can use "mult_medigun_healing_received" and related as a stopgap. Doesn't cover ALL Medic healing, or any Civilian healing (his def. aura!), but hey...
[NON-FUNC] 70 - "health from healers increased" (mult_health_fromhealers)
[NON-FUNC] 112 - "ammo regen" (addperc_ammo_regen)
[NON-FUNC] 113 - "metal regen" (add_metal_regen)
[NON-FUNC] 115 - "mod shovel damage boost" (set_weapon_mode)
[NON-FUNC] 116 - "mod soldier buff type" (set_buff_type)					- I can't test this. It probably doesn't work. It seems to be used for several non-Soldier weapons in live, though, so that's interesting.
[NON-FUNC] 117 - "dmg falloff increased" (mult_dmg_falloff)					- You can modify falloff / rampup with a few attribs, like "mult_falloff_distance" and "custom_falloff"
[NON-FUNC] 118 - "dmg falloff decreased" (mult_dmg_falloff)
[NON-FUNC] 120 - "sticky arm time penalty" (sticky_arm_time)				- I'm surprised this doesn't work yet...
[NON-FUNC] 121 - "stickies detonate stickies" (stickies_detonate_stickies)
[NON-FUNC] 122 - "mod demo buff type" (set_buff_type)
[NON-FUNC] 124 - "mod wrench builds minisentry" (wrench_builds_minisentry)	- You can build Level 1 only's with "add_buildings_max_level"
[NON-FUNC] 126 - "sticky arm time bonus" (sticky_arm_time)
[NON-FUNC] 138 - "dmg penalty vs players" (mult_dmg_vs_players)
[NON-FUNC] 130 - "medic regen bonus" (medic_regen)							- No effect. Use "add_health_regen" instead to get the desired healing buff or debuff.
[NON-FUNC] 131 - "medic regen penalty" (medic_regen)
[NON-FUNC] 136 - "mod sentry killed revenge" (sentry_killed_revenge)
[NON-FUNC] 139 - "lunchbox adds maxhealth bonus" (set_weapon_mode)
[NON-FUNC] 140 - "hidden maxhealth non buffed" (add_maxhealth_nonbuffed)
[NON-FUNC] 146 - "damage applies to sappers" (set_dmg_apply_to_sapper)		- Doesn't work. A workaround is to turn a melee into a Wrench and nerf its Repair and Upgrade Rate into the ground.
[NON-FUNC] 152 - "custom texture lo" (custom_texture_lo)					- This probably requires a connection to Steam itemservers directly. Doubt it could ever work in TF2C.
[NON-FUNC] 154 - "disguise on backstab" (set_disguise_on_backstab)
[NON-FUNC] 155 - "cannot disguise" (set_cannot_disguise)
[NON-FUNC] 156 - "silent killer" (set_silent_killer)						- Can be mostly replicated with "set_silent_killer_no_killfeed", "set_silent_killer_no_scream", and "ragdolls_become_ash"
[NON-FUNC] 157 - "disguise speed penalty" (disguise_speed_penalty)			- Entirely superseded by "mult_disguise_speed", which DOES work!
[NON-FUNC] 163 - "flame life penalty" (mult_flame_life)
[NON-FUNC] 164 - "flame life bonus" (mult_flame_life)
[NON-FUNC] 165 - "charged airblast" (set_charged_airblast)
[NON-FUNC] 167 - "disguise damage reduction" (disguise_damage_reduction)
[NON-FUNC] 168 - "disguise no burn" (disguise_no_burn)
[NON-FUNC] 175 - "jarate duration" (jarate_duration)						- Untestable, but you can sorta do similar things with "add_onhit_addcond".
[NON-FUNC] 176 - "SET BONUS: no death from headshots" (no_death_from_headshots)
[NON-FUNC] 182 - "slow enemy on hit major" (mult_onhit_enemyspeed_major)
[NON-FUNC] 188 - "preserve ubercharge" (preserve_ubercharge)
[NON-FUNC] 190 - "active health regen" (active_item_health_regen)			- Just use a provide on active and "add_health_regen"...
[NON-FUNC] 191 - "active health degen" (active_item_health_regen)
[NON-FUNC] 200 - "enables aoe heal" (enables_aoe_heal)
[NON-FUNC] 201 - "gesture speed increase" (mult_gesture_time)
[NON-FUNC] 204 - "hit self on miss" (hit_self_on_miss)						- This is GREAT flavor text, since it doesn't work in-game at all currently.
[NON-FUNC] 205 - "dmg from ranged reduced" (dmg_from_ranged)				- These are generic ranged and melee, but there exist a few attribs that let you have bullet + flame res and melee vulns.
[NON-FUNC] 206 - "dmg from melee increased" (dmg_from_melee)
[NON-FUNC] 209 - "minicrit vs burning player" (or_minicrit_vs_playercond_burning)	- Can probably use "single_minicrit_vs_playercond_no_dot", for the most part
[NON-FUNC] 217 - "sanguisuge" (sanguisuge)									- Kunai's backstab lifesteal.
[NON-FUNC] 218 - "mark for death" (mark_for_death)							- Non-functional, but you can do something similar with "add_onhit_addcond" and the Marked for Death attribute.
[NON-FUNC] 219 - "decapitate type" (decapitate_type)						- So, no head? In seriousness, "mod_melee_crit_swing_custom_damage" can be used for decaps, but only on crit melee kills!
[NON-FUNC] 220 - "restore health on kill" (restore_health_on_kill)			- For the most part, just have a prov. on active "heal_on_kill" with a static number, maybe some percent of the Class' health. It won't change with HP-modifying items, but does it really matter?
[NON-FUNC] 222 - "mult sniper charge after bodyshot" (mult_sniper_charge_after_bodyshot)
[NON-FUNC] 223 - "mult sniper charge after miss" (mult_sniper_charge_after_miss)

[NON-FUNC] 225 - "dmg penalty while half alive" (mult_dmg_penalty_while_half_alive)
[NON-FUNC] 226 - "honorbound" (honorbound)
[NON-FUNC] 227 - "custom texture hi" (custom_texture_hi)
[NON-FUNC] 230 - "mod medic killed revenge" (medic_killed_revenge)			- These are insanely difficult to test, but I did one and it didn't seem like it worked. Not surprised.

[NON-FUNC] 233 - "mod medic healed damage bonus" (medic_healed_damage_bonus)
[NON-FUNC] 235 - "mod shovel speed boost" (set_weapon_mode)

[NON-FUNC] 239 - "ubercharge rate bonus for healer" (mult_uberchargerate_for_healer)
[NON-FUNC] 240 - "reload time decreased while healed" (mult_reload_time_while_healed)
[NON-FUNC] 242 - "mod medic killed marked for death" (medic_killed_marked_for_death)
[NON-FUNC] 243 - "mod rage on hit penalty" (rage_on_hit)					- I can't say confidently if any of these 3 would work or not. There's nothing that uses "rage" in TF2C. Keep an eye on these.
[NON-FUNC] 244 - "mod rage on hit bonus" (rage_on_hit)
[NON-FUNC] 245 - "mod rage damage boost" (rage_damage)
[NON-FUNC] 246 - "mult charge turn control" (charge_turn_control)			- TF2C's charging doesn't seem to even have a turn-speed limiter to begin with, so these are moot for now
[NON-FUNC] 247 - "no charge impact range" (no_charge_impact_range)
[NON-FUNC] 248 - "charge impact damage increased" (charge_impact_damage)	- Can replicate using "mult_shield_bash_damage"	or similar
[NON-FUNC] 249 - "charge recharge rate increased" (charge_recharge_rate)	- Somewhat a property you can modify from using "add_wearable_cond_on_secondary_attack". However, that's on the item itself, you can't modify that number with other items (a-la Claid)
[NON-FUNC] 250 - "air dash count" (air_dash_count)
[NON-FUNC] 251 - "speed buff ally" (speed_buff_ally)						- Not much we can do to actually apply existing speed conds onto allies...
[NON-FUNC] 255 - "airblast pushback scale" (airblast_pushback_scale)
[NON-FUNC] 257 - "airblast vertical pushback scale" (airblast_vertical_pushback_scale)
[NON-FUNC] 258 - "ammo becomes health" (ammo_becomes_health)
[NON-FUNC] 265 - "mod mini-crit airborne deploy" (mini_crit_airborne_deploy)
[NON-FUNC] 268 - "mult sniper charge penalty DISPLAY ONLY" (mult_sniper_charge_base_dummy) - It DOES say it's display-only.
[NON-FUNC] 269 - "mod see enemy health" (see_enemy_health)
[NON-FUNC] 270 - "powerup max charges" (powerup_max_charges)				- There's no equivalent item in TF2C, so doubtless these are unused and unworking. Can't test.
[NON-FUNC] 271 - "powerup charges" (powerup_charges)
[NON-FUNC] 272 - "powerup duration" (powerup_duration)
[NON-FUNC] 273 - "critboost" (critboost)									- These are for the canteen, they don't do anything beside show text.
[NON-FUNC] 274 - "ubercharge" (ubercharge)
[NON-FUNC] 275 - "cancel falling damage" (cancel_falling_damage)			- Can maybe do "mult_dmgtaken_from_fall" at 0...
[NON-FUNC] 276 - "bidirectional teleport" (bidirectional_teleport)			- This IS actually technically possible already in-game with some clever use of Console Commands / entity keyvalues, but the attribute itself doesn't function.
[NON-FUNC] 277 - "multiple sentries" (multiple_sentries)
[NON-FUNC] 282 - "energy weapon charged shot" (energy_weapon_charged_shot)
[NON-FUNC] 283 - "energy weapon penetration" (energy_weapon_penetration)
[NON-FUNC] 284 - "energy weapon no hurt building" (energy_weapon_no_hurt_building)	- Just use something like "mult_dmg_vs_buildings" for this!
[NON-FUNC] 285 - "energy weapon no deflect" (energy_weapon_no_deflect)
[NON-FUNC] 288 - "no crit boost" (no_crit_boost)
[NON-FUNC] 295 - "has pipboy build interface" (set_custom_buildmenu)
[NON-FUNC] 296 - "sapper kills collect crits" (sapper_kills_collect_crits)
[NON-FUNC] 297 - "sniper only fire zoomed" (sniper_only_fire_zoomed)
[NON-FUNC] 299 - "add onhit addammo" (add_onhit_addammo)					- Can kinda do this with "add_ammo_on_hit" - which works for your active weapon.
[NON-FUNC] 300 - "electrical airblast DISPLAY ONLY" (electrical_airblast_DISPLAY_ONLY)
[NON-FUNC] 304 - "sniper full charge damage bonus" (sniper_full_charge_damage_bonus)
[NON-FUNC] 305 - "sniper fires tracer" (sniper_fires_tracer)				- You can kiiiinda do this with certain "tracer_effect" tracers...
[NON-FUNC] 306 - "sniper no headshot without full charge" (sniper_no_headshot_without_full_charge)
[NON-FUNC] 307 - "mod no reload DISPLAY ONLY" (mod_no_reload_display_only)	- Display only. Discussed above how you can get no-reloading to work.
[NON-FUNC] 308 - "sniper penetrate players when charged" (sniper_penetrate_players_when_charged)
[NON-FUNC] 309 - "crit kill will gib" (crit_kill_will_gib)					- You can use "mod_melee_crit_swing_custom_damage" to set Gibbing on crit kill - and more!
[NON-FUNC] 310 - "recall" (recall)											- Could use this as cheeky text for something that just bloody kills you!
[NON-FUNC] 312 - "disable weapon hiding for animations" (disable_weapon_hiding_for_animations) - Supposed to keep the weapon visible while you do stuff like taunt..? A bit flawed since most taunts just animate the weapons away to begin with...
[NON-FUNC] 313 - "applies snare effect" (applies_snare_effect)				- I don't know what this does, but I'd assume it was similar to "mod_tranq_onhit" - a new TF2C attribute.
[NON-FUNC] 315 - "refill_ammo" (refill_ammo)
[NON-FUNC] 319 - "increase buff duration" (mod_buff_duration)				- Probably would work if they add anything that uses a "buff". It doesn't do anything for Civilian's Mini-crit buff.
[NON-FUNC] 320 - "robo sapper" (robo_sapper)
[NON-FUNC] 321 - "build rate bonus" (mod_build_rate)						- Doesn't work by itself, but the individual build rate multipliers for each building work.
[NON-FUNC] 323 - "attack projectiles" (attack_projectiles)
[NON-FUNC] 324 - "accuracy scales damage" (accuracy_scales_damage)
[NON-FUNC] 327 - "building instant upgrade" (building_instant_upgrade)
[NON-FUNC] 329 - "airblast vulnerability multiplier" (airblast_vulnerability_multiplier)
[NON-FUNC] 330 - "override footstep sound set" (override_footstep_sound_set)	- Would be useful for "mod_armor_footsteps"
[NON-FUNC] 331 - "spawn with physics toy" (spawn_with_physics_toy)
[NON-FUNC] 332 - "fish damage override" (fish_damage_override)				- This is probably supposed to toggle between FISH KILL! and ARM KILL!
[NON-FUNC] 333 - "SET BONUS: special dsp" (special_dsp)						- Doesn't.. seem to work? My ears aren't what they used to be.
[NON-FUNC] 334 - "bombinomicon effect on death" (bombinomicon_effect_on_death)
[NON-FUNC] 335 - "clip size bonus upgrade" (mult_clipsize_upgrade)			- Just use "mult_clipsize", this doesn't work.
[NON-FUNC] 336 - "hide enemy health" (hide_enemy_health)
[NON-FUNC] 337 - "subtract victim medigun charge on hit" (subtract_victim_medigun_charge_onhit)
[NON-FUNC] 338 - "subtract victim cloak on hit" (subtract_victim_cloak_on_hit)
[NON-FUNC] 339 - "reveal cloaked victim on hit" (reveal_cloaked_victim_on_hit)	- The name doesn't make it clear, I believe this is supposed to forcefully uncloak a Spy who you hit while cloaked. It doesn't work, though (thank god).
[NON-FUNC] 340 - "reveal disguised victim on hit" (reveal_disguised_victim_on_hit)
[NON-FUNC] 341 - "jarate backstabber" (jarate_backstabber)					- Australian defensive mechanism (pisses himself when attacked)

[NON-FUNC] 352 - "alt fire teleport to spawn" (alt_fire_teleport_to_spawn)
[NON-FUNC] 354 - "stun enemies wielding same weapon" (stun_enemies_wielding_same_weapon)
[NON-FUNC] 355 - "mod ammo per shot missed DISPLAY ONLY" (mod_ammo_per_shot_missed_DISPLAY_ONLY)
[NON-FUNC] 357 - "increase buff duration hidden" (mod_buff_duration)
[NON-FUNC] 358 - "crit forces victim to laugh" (crit_forces_victim_to_laugh)
[NON-FUNC] 359 - "melts in fire" (melts_in_fire)
[NON-FUNC] 360 - "damage all connected" (damage_all_connected)
[NON-FUNC] 361 - "become fireproof on hit by fire" (become_fireproof_on_hit_by_fire)	- You could use "mult_dmgtaken_from_fire" and have it only apply when the weapon is in your hands?
[NON-FUNC] 363 - "crit does no damage" (crit_does_no_damage)
[NON-FUNC] 364 - "add jingle to footsteps" (add_jingle_to_footsteps)		- Might be possible if they let us change what sound is played for "mod_armor_footsteps"				
[NON-FUNC] 365 - "set icicle knife mode" (set_weapon_mode)
[NON-FUNC] 366 - "mod stun waist high airborne" (stun_waist_high_airborne)
[NON-FUNC] 367 - "extinguish earns revenge crits" (extinguish_revenge)
[NON-FUNC] 368 - "burn damage earns rage" (burn_damage_earns_rage)
